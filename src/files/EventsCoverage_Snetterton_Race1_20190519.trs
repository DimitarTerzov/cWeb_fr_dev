<Sync time="18.135"/>
[music] Good morning everybody. Welcome to the Snetterton three hundred circuit, a sunny Snetterton three hundred circuit. I'm delighted to say some early morning clouds starting to be burnt away [breath] and the temperature is starting to rise.
<Sync time="30.364"/>
[music] The ambient temperature, the temperature on the [laugh] track is set to rise [breath] significantly over the course of the next hour or so, because round number three of the two thousand and nineteen British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Championship [breath] is coming up very shortly.
<Sync time="43.971"/>
[music] Indeed we've got a field of delectable supercars in ((grid)) by &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three [breath] and &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four. Top-level professional drivers, some of the best amateur drivers [breath] in the country as well [breath] and two short sharp one-hour sprint races
<Sync time="58.645"/>
[music] essentially [breath] to keep us entertained throughout the day. Well, my name is Andy McEwan. I will be one of [breath] several voices keeping you up to date with what's going on out on the circuit today. I'm delighted to say that I'm joined in the comment box all-day, [breath] and for both of these British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; races by Graham Goodwin.
<Sync time="73.257"/>
[music] And Graham, [breath] I think both of us when we're watching the cars heading out of the pit lane just a few moments ago, we're drooling more than slightly, weren't we, at the prospects of this one?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="81.986" endTime="108.284">
<Sync time="81.986"/>
[music] Yeah, Absolutely. Good afternoon. Or good morning rather, everybody. It's been a long day already. #uh, But, #uh, yeah, it's not just watching them, it's listening to them. And that's the great thing about &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; racing, its variety. You can tell what that car is just by listening to it rather than just looking at it.
<Sync time="96.538"/>
[music] But why would you just listen [breath] when you can watch these fantastic pieces of machinery, [breath] packed grids in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three and in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four and with more variety than most championships around the world can muster.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="108.284" endTime="125.187">
<Sync time="108.284"/>
[music] Yeah, exactly. This is a, a really, [noise] really high-quality line up this year, arguably the highest quality line up [breath] we've had for quite some time.
<Sync time="115.887"/>
[noise] Well, that's us two in the comment box, down [breath] in the heart of all the action there as ever, [breath] #uh, is Andy Jay. And Andy, I believe you found us a guest commentator for today.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="125.187" endTime="139.341">
<Sync time="125.187"/>
[noise] I have. I have found you a guest commentator who was just ((lurking)) around and I thought we should probably grab him. And you're right incidentally about the weather. It is heating up big style, when we arrived it was, well, it was looking like it was gonna be a chilly one. And Joe, Snetterton in the sunshine, barrels of fun, isn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="139.341" endTime="156.059">
<Sync time="139.341"/>
[noise] Yeah, it doesn't get better than this, #uh, especially with the British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; format we did here, the two one-hour sprint races tend to lead to a little bit more action. #uh, You've got up to a grid full of cars, a mixture of &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Threes at the front, and Fours at the back and all the drivers thinking they should be further up the grid than they're probably qualified.
<Sync time="154.138"/>
[noise] So, #uh, I think it's gonna be a good day of racing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="156.059" endTime="166.944">
<Sync time="156.059"/>
[noise] I love it. You're speaking from experience there, &lt;lang:French&gt; Mon Frere &lt;/lang:French&gt;. We obviously miss you [breath] not being in a car, but we get you in the comment box, so that's great. Now, let's just have a quick word [breath] about Snetterton. It's all about kind of coming cleanly out of the second corner, isn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="166.944" endTime="188.982">
<Sync time="166.944"/>
[noise] Exactly. #uh, It's all gonna concertina out there, a big hairpin, so you'll be fifth gear, hundred and twenty, one hundred and thirty miles an hour down to about thirty-five forty. So that's like losing your license on the motorway to driving past a school sort of speed.
<Sync time="178.239"/>
[noise] So [breath] that's where everyone concertina is up when you've got thirty-plus cars on the grid, it only takes one guy to break too late and it all goes wrong for everyone. So eyes forward and, #uh, hopefully, everyone's clean-ish.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="188.982" endTime="203.309">
<Sync time="188.982"/>
[noise] I could have picked you up on the school thing there, mate, you can't go forty past the school, that's, #uh, you've got to go quite a bit slower than that. [breath] #um, Now, who do you fancy? It's, it's so hard to pick a favorite at this point, 'cause we're only two races in, of course. But, well, three races now. [breath] But nonetheless, who's standing out for you?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="203.309" endTime="237.735">
<Sync time="203.309"/>
[noise] I think you've got to look at the Barwell. Lamborghinis have been strong again, both are amateurs. Sam De Haan and Adam Balon stepping up to &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three are doing a mega job and they're our first two arms on the grid. [breath] The other two cars on the front two rows are both silver cars, so younger professionals.
<Sync time="217.059"/>
[noise] So it's gonna be an interesting dynamic. We've got, #uh, Gamble here behind us who's having to carry an extra sixty kilos, #um, so he's got a lot of work to do. But he's got the, the youth and the experience on Sam De Haan next to him. So [breath] I think we're probably gonna see the &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; lead.
<Sync time="230.233"/>
[noise] And then with the sixty kilos, he's gonna work his tires and breaks that little bit harder, [breath] #uh, and it's gonna be difficult. But if I was a betting man, I'd put it on Gamble.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="237.735" endTime="250.732">
<Sync time="237.735"/>
[noise] All right, I like it. He's thought that one through. Thank you, Joe. You'd be able to hear Joe Osborn joining the lads in commentary. And I'll tell you what, guys, I'm, I'm gonna see who I can line up. #um, As you can see, the cars are still pulling in and, #uh, I'll come back to you very shortly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="250.732" endTime="253.875">
<Sync time="250.732"/>
[noise] Thanks, Andy. I'm not sure about this Joe Osborn bloke. He's been too good at this, isn't he, Graham?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="253.875" endTime="293.834">
<Sync time="253.875"/>
[noise] Yeah, (()) passing schools bit, that's, #uh, there he should need some lessons I'm afraid, but, of course, championship-winning driver in Europe in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, a decade ago, Joe Osborn. I still think he was a young [laugh] whippersnapper, #um,
<Sync time="265.806"/>
[noise] just off aboard one of our three Camry cars for these two one hour encounters. This is the Barwell Motorsport number sixty-nine Lamborghini Huracan &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three, that fantastic five-point-two liter V-ten engine
<Sync time="278.909"/>
[noise] screaming it away in the, in the rear of that car. #um, And, and that will be adding immeasurably to the soundtrack of this packed grid. Packed and very grid. Sam De Haan will start that car for this, #uh, first race.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="293.834" endTime="327.311">
<Sync time="293.834"/>
[overlap] Indeed and Sam, one of those drivers who's really improved an awful lot in [breath] a relatively short space of time, it's, #uh, always fascinating to watch these youngsters, isn't it? As they [breath] make some of their first steps into motor racing.
<Sync time="305.486"/>
[noise] And Sam, [breath] it was only a year or so ago that he was sort of midfield runner in Master Mix Five racing. And now here he is [breath] running right at the front because Sam De Haan along with, #uh, his co-driver Jonny Cocker [breath] are the championship leaders
<Sync time="317.661"/>
[noise] coming into this race by seven points in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three. [breath] Well, as Sam De Haan arrives at his grid slot down and amongst it all once again is Andy Jay. Andy, who have you got?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="327.311" endTime="339.911">
<Sync time="327.311"/>
[noise] Yeah, I've got Jack Mitchell who, of course, shares the car with Sam, and I'll tell you what, this is gonna be really interesting, wasn't it? You, you must love the fact that you're starting in pole, although [breath] even though you're not starting in the car, you're looking a little bit nervous already.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk5" startTime="339.911" endTime="374.458">
<Sync time="339.911"/>
[noise] You're always gonna be nervous. Yeah, British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt;, #um, Tom did an ama~, amazing job yesterday, #uh, to get pole position, #uh, [breath] we know in the race, #uh, because we've got the sixty kilos and it's gonna be a bit, pretty difficult towards the end of the race especially with the pros, so [breath] trying to chase me down. So I think the race, if it goes to plan with Tom in front, #uh,
<Sync time="354.788"/>
[noise] he'll get a gap, but then another second half of the race I think it'll be me trying to [breath] defend for my life and, #uh, get the rest of them behind. But I think this is probably our best chance for our podium, #um, [breath] and I think me and Tom have done a good job so far with the, the extra added weight in from Oulton Park, but I think we've just got to make the most of it.
<Sync time="369.194"/>
[noise] It's one of them weekends, which isn't going to plan, but, #um, [lipsmack] I mean, that's where you can make the most points out for a championship, so.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="374.458" endTime="386.349">
<Sync time="374.458"/>
[noise] I mean, when you say it's not going to plan, and we are stood in front of you on pole position, that's a, that's a pretty good non-planned weekend in my view. [breath] Just talk about the sixty kilos, to a layman how much of a difference will that feel in the car?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk5" startTime="386.349" endTime="398.527">
<Sync time="386.349"/>
[noise] [breath] [lipsmack] Yeah. #um, I was just looking at the data over the weekend, we've seen that it's more on braking zones, and the corner, the, the pull out of the corner. Straight-line speed hasn't been affected luckily and, #uh, positive &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; have given us a good engine, it, #uh, pulls out of the corners quite nicely, but.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="398.527" endTime="400.258">
<Sync time="398.527"/>
[noise] [overlap] It's mostly about your thinking.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk5" startTime="400.258" endTime="414.319">
<Sync time="400.258"/>
[noise] A little bit, yeah, it's always at the back of your mind a little bit especially towards the end of the race. It's probably not a bit nice in the tires as it would be with the other cars. So, #um, [lipsmack] like I said, #um, I'm getting familiar with the weight now. It's all a bit, a little bit different, we haven't tested it before. [breath] So it's all a bit new to us, but now I think it's to make the most of it, and, #uh, do the best we can.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="414.319" endTime="441.96">
<Sync time="414.319"/>
[noise] We love it. Exciting. Good luck, Jack. [overlap] Thanks for talking to me, I appreciate it. [breath] #um, [noise] Right, let's see who else is around, [overlap] shall we? #um, Oh, we are being told to clear the grid. But common let's, let's nip down and grab Phil Keen, because he is actually the most successful driver [breath] in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; history around Snetterton,
<Sync time="428.300"/>
[noise] would you believe? [breath] #um, Phil, hello, we're live. [overlap] I know you're not a swearer, but [overlap] nonetheless. #um, That statistic about you that I've just mentioned to our, our fine viewers here. You're the most successful British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; driver at Snetterton, [breath] are you feeling the pressure of that?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="441.96" endTime="450.44">
<Sync time="441.96"/>
[noise] [laugh] Well, oh, no, not really. I mean, I've been very fortunate, I've had a good car and [breath] good teams for the last six years of the doing it so [breath] you know, no pressure.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="450.44" endTime="454.073">
<Sync time="450.44"/>
[noise] You're being far too humble, I shou~, I also shouldn't bring up your Blancpain win as well then I guess.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="454.073" endTime="462.63">
<Sync time="454.073"/>
[noise] Oh, well, [laugh] yeah, we finished second, we didn't win, [overlap] but you know. Close enough, [laugh] #um, so, yeah. No, the guys have done a good job this weekend, so we'll, #uh, we'll see what we can do.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="462.63" endTime="463.763">
<Sync time="462.63"/>
[noise] You're feeling good, you're feeling sharp?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="463.763" endTime="469.389">
<Sync time="463.763"/>
[noise] Yeah, I think so, and the car is feeling good, you know, the engineer has not done a bad job, so, you know, we'll see what we can do.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="469.389" endTime="503.128">
<Sync time="469.389"/>
[noise] God, if I were an engineer and I heard I might be, #uh, having a little word in your shell. [laugh] [breath] I think he needs your nectar points. Good luck, [overlap] enjoy it. Take care, mate. [breath] #um, We are gonna run down to &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four just in case, because I hope we've still got time. [breath] #uh, There's a brand new car joining us in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four today,
<Sync time="483.551"/>
[noise] #uh, which actually makes this a record-breaking grid for &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, [breath] #uh, we have nine different manufacturers. [breath] I'm trying to get down to the Audi, of course, I forget just how many cars we're looking at, thirty-six super tuned race machines, it's pretty fantastic.
<Sync time="496.736"/>
[noise] I'll tell you what, because I don't wanna look like a Challenge Anneka. [breath] Let me, #uh, let me not run on camera, I'll do this off-air. [laugh] Here we go.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="503.128" endTime="529.315">
<Sync time="503.128"/>
[noise] [laugh] Possibly a good idea there, Andy, [laugh] as he dashes off [breath] down the grid. He's right though, isn't he, Graham? This is an enormous grid of cars, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three [breath] is in fine health, but &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four category not just in the &lt;initial&gt; UK &lt;/initial&gt;,
<Sync time="515.831"/>
[noise] but globally [breath] has just exploded into life over the last year and a half or so, hasn't it? [breath] It is the place to be if you're a manufacturer, [breath] if you're a driver trying to make your first step into top-level &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; racing. &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, what a place to be.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="529.315" endTime="572.607">
<Sync time="529.315"/>
[noise] Absolutely. It's really into its stride. And I think we've got better variety in this championship than just about anywhere else on the planet for a national championship and pretty, pretty, well, #uh, most of the international, #uh, championships as well. [breath]
<Sync time="542.009"/>
[noise] New cars of Aston Martin here as we have Andy there on his way down to see what the new additions to [breath] the grid here. Steller Motorsport coming back with the number twenty-nine. #uh, Audi, the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four car there another fabulous piece of kit.
<Sync time="554.941"/>
[noise] The Mustangs, three Mustangs, #uh, on the grid here. The &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt;s, the &lt;initial&gt; KTM &lt;/initial&gt;, the &lt;initial&gt; AMG &lt;/initial&gt;, you could go on and on and on,
<Sync time="563.383"/>
[noise] #uh, and you're not gonna run out of the, #uh, you're not gonna run out of variety that you're gonna get in a packed twenty-plus car, #uh, grid in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="572.607" endTime="581.088">
<Sync time="572.607"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] Well, and you're quite right, Graham. I~, It's a fantastic grid. And then amongst it all now, down, hopefully, at the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four end [breath] is Andy Jay.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="581.088" endTime="599.384">
<Sync time="581.088"/>
[noise] I certainly am. Yeah, we are right at the second P-two in actual fact, [breath] #um, with the Audi. I've got Sennan here now. Sennan, this is a, a historic moment. An historic moment. I should be correct in English, shouldn't I? [breath]
<Sync time="591.15"/>
[noise] #uh, with the Audi starting, #er, in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; making it nine manufacturers. [breath] Are you feeling any of that pressure? The R-Eight is looking good, does it feel good?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk7" startTime="599.384" endTime="631.859">
<Sync time="599.384"/>
[noise] Yeah, the, the car feels absolutely amazing, stellar performance and the, the Audi R-Eight's performing really well this week, and we've literally come, brought the car out of the box with no testing and to be up at the front straightaway, it's, #er, [breath] it's clearly a proven car.
<Sync time="612.903"/>
[noise] #um, me and Richard have just had to adjust our driving styles a little bit to suit the car, and straightaway, we're [breath] battling at the front, which is what we wanted to see. So yeah, I'm e~, excited for this race. #um, Obviously, it's, [breath] there's a lot of cars out there.
<Sync time="625.997"/>
[noise] We're not sure what the race is going to bring. But I've, I've just told Richard, go out there and enjoy it and what will be, will be.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="631.859" endTime="641.233">
<Sync time="631.859"/>
[noise] Well, you've answered some very early questions, you know, with Mustangs and [breath] Aston's and McLaren's all around you, people were kind of going, what's the Au~, what's the Audi going to be like? [breath] Well starting at P-Two, [breath] pretty swift.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk7" startTime="641.233" endTime="660.307">
<Sync time="641.233"/>
[noise] Yeah, definitely. I think it's, #er, proven itself straightaway. We didn't get [breath] as much running as we wanted in, #er, free practice one, and free practice two, so is it going into qualifying? No idea where it was going to be, so, #uh, to be starting here for the race, it's definitely a big confidence boost,
<Sync time="654.109"/>
[noise] [breath] but yeah, we'll just, #er, hopefully, we can stay around this area towards the end of the race and see what position we'll come in, in.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="660.307" endTime="670.253">
<Sync time="660.307"/>
[noise] Sounds good. Stay safe and enjoy it. [overlap] Thanks for talking to us. We've gotta dash, [breath] brilliant. #um, Guys, it's pretty much race time. How exciting is this? #uh, I'm gonna hand back to you, because, #uh, I have to clear off.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="670.253" endTime="675.357">
<Sync time="670.253"/>
[noise] [laugh] Yes, I think you ought to, because it's about to get very noisy down there on the, #er, grid, isn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="675.357" endTime="714.505">
<Sync time="675.357"/>
[noise] It is and just another quick factoid about the Audi's effort. Steller motor~, Motorsports, [breath] still have that program in the background with another manufacturer of &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, [breath]
<Sync time="685.035"/>
[noise] but team principal and their lead technical guy both involved in British Touring Cars back in nineteen ninety-six [breath] with Frank Bigler and Audi and they're back with the mark. They made that championship success, #er, well, well over twenty years ago now. [breath]
<Sync time="699.747"/>
[noise] #um, And great to see them back up at the showup end here. This is going to be Mega. Sixty minutes of fantastic entertainment to come. The McLaren seven-twenty S safety car will lead this field away. #er, Well, what are we gonna look forward to here, Andy? [laugh] You're the expert, come on.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="714.505" endTime="972.9">
<Sync time="714.505"/>
[noise] [laugh] Well, that's the thing, isn't it, because you don't know where to look in these races. Oulton Park was frantic from start to finish quite literally. We have the [breath] two leaders in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three making contact, the lap and a half into the first race.
<Sync time="726.813"/>
[noise] We have the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four battles getting [breath] a little bit physical at times as well and then when the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three battles capture the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four battles to lap them, [breath] well, all hell breaks loose then and it gets rather entertaining. [breath] &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; and Lamborghini there on the front row of the grid for &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three.
<Sync time="740.024"/>
[noise] Century Motorsports ahead of Barwell, the sixty-ninth car [breath] in second position on the grid is the championship-leading car as I said you've got Barwell, our first and second in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three at the moment. Onboard here with the number forty-seven &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Sports car, Jonny Adam.
<Sync time="753.716"/>
[noise] &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Sport really could do [breath] with just a clean race quite honestly. They had a bit of nightmare at, #uh, Oulton park, particularly number two that was involved in three separate spins or accidents [breath] within the first lap and a half of the season.
<Sync time="765.68"/>
[noise] So well, Mark Farmer will be hoping for [breath] a cleaner start in [music] car number two. [breath] In car number nine, though Tom Gamble will take the start for Century Motorsport. They're one of [breath] the three silver-silver driver combos in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three [breath] with Barwell, Sam De Haan alongside.
<Sync time="778.488"/>
[music] Adam Balon in the next Barwell Lamborghini has Glynn Geddie's, #um, Bentley's Team Parker Racing Bentley alongside on row two. [breath] Oliver Wilkinson is the first Aston Martin for Optimum he's fifth with Shaun Balfe in the new McLaren &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three [breath] sixth on the grid.
<Sync time="791.593"/>
[music] The second &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt;, Dominic Paul has got Graham Davidson [breath] in the &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Sport car alongside. [breath] Mike Igoe and Rick Parfitt Junior who missed a gear in his quickest qualifying lap yesterday. [breath] That's why he's further down the order than we expected.
<Sync time="803.96"/>
[music] Beechdean's Andrew Howard and &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt;. Sport's Mark Farmer make up the sixth row [breath] ahead of Richard Neary and our first &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four car, Scott Maxwell [breath] in the number fifteen Ford Mustang. Steller Performance's Audi Richard Williams is next, ahead of Josh Price, former &lt;initial&gt; BTCC &lt;/initial&gt; racer. [breath]
<Sync time="818.152"/>
[music] Callum Pointon &lt;initial&gt; HHC &lt;/initial&gt; and Josh Smith up for the Tolman with a pair of McLarens next up in the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four grid. [breath] Mark Kimber and Luke Williams are our next, Longley Williams former Formula Ford star, [breath] and then just outside the top twenty overall,
<Sync time="830.864"/>
[music] but well and truly within the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four scrum [breath] will be Lewis Proctor and Mark Murffit in the Fox Motorsport Mercedes who showed some flashes of speed [breath] last time out. The Second Multimatic Ford Mustang has new drivers this weekend. Alistair Mckinnon will take the start in that car.
<Sync time="844.677"/>
[music] [breath] Andrew Gordon-Colebrooke and Nick Jones want to keep an eye I reckon in the Team Parker Racing Mercedes twenty-sixth on the grid. [breath] Ash Hand, and Mike Robinson are next up. Again, just star drivers up and down the order. [breath] Sam Smelt raced in &lt;initial&gt; BTCC &lt;/initial&gt; last year
<Sync time="857.869"/>
[music] so too the pri~, in the past, [breath] has Kelvin Fletcher who's getting quicker and quicker every time he hits the circuit. [breath] Graham Johnson for Balfe Motorsport is next ahead of Ben Hurst with Mike McCollum for the Track Focused &lt;initial&gt; KTM &lt;/initial&gt; Crossbow [breath] and Paul Vice in the Jaguar.
<Sync time="870.895"/>
[music] They got a podium [music] last time out. Alex Toth-Jones and Chris Car at the back of the grid [lipsmack] as we [breath] get set to go racing. [noise] One hour, there is a mandatory pitstop that must be made by every car.
<Sync time="883.318"/>
[noise] There are pitstop windows that we'll get into later on the [breath] &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three cars and the GT Four cars have slightly different windows in which they can, [breath] #uh, come into the pit late to make that pit stop. The driver changes will take place then, [breath] the am driver incidentally is the driver
<Sync time="897.191"/>
[noise] that will start this race. So for all Pro-Am [breath] combinations, it is the amateur driver that set the qualifying time for this first race. They fore, they therefore start this one. [breath] Race two is the other way round. The pros go first and the ams take the cars to the finish. [breath]
<Sync time="910.735"/>
[noise] For the Silver-silver driver combos, they can sort of chop and change as they like, but they have that wait penalty [breath] and in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four case, longer pitstops to serve as well. Place your bets everybody,
<Sync time="920.815"/>
[noise] side by side for round number three of the two thousand and nineteen British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Championship with Tom Gamble [breath] and Sam De Haan, making up the front row of the grid. [breath] Lights will go out shortly, away we go.
<Sync time="933.023"/>
[noise] The thunder rises and already we've got a &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Sport that's departed on the grass on the road down towards the first corner, [breath] it's a narrow pitch straight, but I think they've all had significant contact. Tom Gamble will lead the way. [breath] #uh, Looks as though the Glynn Geddie driven, [breath] #uh, Bentley, within the third position.
<Sync time="946.887"/>
[noise] They, they made a good start at Oulton Park before that contact [breath] down at (()). They gain ground here as well. Into third position, oh, contact between the race leaders. Tom Gamble gets knocked out the way by Sam De Haan [breath] and Glynn Geddie comes charging past the pair of them [breath] into the race lead.
<Sync time="960.677"/>
[noise] Ollie Wilkinson in the Optimum Motorsports. Aston Martin goes third. The team ABBA Car is on the grass that was with an issue, [breath] we have to assume after contact. We thought he might get congested out down (()) Joe Osborn and it really did.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="972.9" endTime="992.463">
<Sync time="972.9"/>
[noise] Yeah, it looks like Sam De Haan just slightly outbroke himself. Gamble (()) #uh, lift up the throttle. It also looks like Farmer had some smoke coming out of the back there, sorry, #er, Optimum &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four for the grass the inside as well, so [breath] action coming thick and fast as, #er, we did expect,
<Sync time="986.813"/>
[noise] but, #uh, it looks like overall, (()) at least person continue I would say after this, #uh, first half of lap.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="992.463" endTime="995.764">
<Sync time="992.463"/>
[noise] Oh, [overlap] #uh, and this is the team ABBA car, isn't it, Graham? That is not healthy.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="995.764" endTime="1005.016">
<Sync time="995.764"/>
[noise] No, that's not going any further, is it? Number eight car. Seventy-five car, by the way, has recovered from that grassy moment and has rejoined with the eighth-car in major trouble or rather was trying to rejoin.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1005.016" endTime="1007.782">
<Sync time="1005.016"/>
[noise] That's [overlap] possible damage I think, is there?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1007.782" endTime="1010.639">
<Sync time="1007.782"/>
[noise] And also trouble for one of the Century M-fours.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1010.639" endTime="1077.254">
<Sync time="1010.639"/>
[noise] #er, Yeah, I can't quite see the number on that one but, #er, they had a troubling time, an old car last time out, but fortunately, things not improving here. Glynn Geddie [breath] immediately gets rid of those plastic markers on the apex down (()), but he is starting to pull away there, [breath]
<Sync time="1022.869"/>
[noise] but we thought he might be one the, #uh, silver-silver driver combos that led to the opening lap. He's not necessarily the one that we expected, [breath] but it will be, it would appear the Team Parker Racing Bentley that has the best of the starts there. The second of the Century Motorsport &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; is that car started by Dominic Paul.
<Sync time="1036.353"/>
[noise] [breath] And he's running in, I reckon that's fifth position [breath] as the leaders come out of the final corner Murrays for the first time after what has been a frantic opening lap of racing here at Snetterton [breath] and let's count them across the line then. It's Glynn Geddie that leads the way.
<Sync time="1049.108"/>
[noise] Tom Gamble [breath] in second position, he's one point four seconds behind him. Ollie Wilkinsons of the third ahead of Sam De Haan, fourth. [breath] It looks like the wing there is flapping off the Optimum Motorsports Aston Martin after [breath] a bit of rubbing on the opening lap. De Haan, fourth, then Adam Balon, his teammate, is fifth, Dominic Paul sixth [breath]
<Sync time="1062.529"/>
[noise] and Rick Parfitt Junior is seventh, so he's had a really good star. [breath] In &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four by the way, it is going to be the Audis, that Stellar Performance Audi with a stellar opening lap [breath] and they have taken advantage of some of the shuffling in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four to take the lead. The Multimatic car, Graham, down to third.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1077.254" endTime="1087.913">
<Sync time="1077.254"/>
[noise] Absolutely, great stuff. Richard Williams in the number twenty-nine car, #er, pulled out a, an excellent second position on the debut for the team with this brand new car and he's pulling away here.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1087.913" endTime="1159.225">
<Sync time="1087.913"/>
[noise] That Mustang does not sound nice, does it? As it now applies the pressure for [breath] a second position. So the number fifteen car [breath] has been started by Scott Maxwell. He's looking to the inside here down towards (()) Callum Pointon [breath] in &lt;initial&gt; HHC &lt;/initial&gt; McLaren,
<Sync time="1100.919"/>
[noise] he's trying to overtake and does overtake [breath] with a nice move under braking. Can the McLaren [breath] fight back on the next of the corner? [breath] No, it's can't, nice move and now it sets off, sets off after the Steller Performance Audi had.
<Sync time="1113.086"/>
[noise] So through Hamilton they go down towards the right ((under)) Audis and [breath] in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four for the early shuffling as we expected. There is the &lt;initial&gt; WPI &lt;/initial&gt;, #er, racing Lamborghini. That's Michael Igoe who started, that's first appearance in the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three category.
<Sync time="1125.836"/>
[noise] They were out in &lt;initial&gt; GTC &lt;/initial&gt; last time out in a, a class of their own in their Porsche. They've upgraded now to a &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three car, albeit not the Porsche we anticipated they would. They were in a Lamborghini instead. [breath] We can't have too many Lamborghinis, can you really? And they are already putting it at the top ten overall.
<Sync time="1140.816"/>
[noise] [breath] Right, Barwell Lamborghinis at play here then, Graham. Sam De Haan, [breath] we know that he was involved in a bit of contact at the hairpin. If there is any damage that may explain [breath] why Adam Balon is really starting to apply the pressure. [breath] If you're the team manager,
<Sync time="1153.571"/>
[noise] do you [breath] sort of send that message out that Adam is faster than you, you need to get out of his way and do you just let them race?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1159.225" endTime="1173.551">
<Sync time="1159.225"/>
[noise] #uh, You let them race. He's certainly got some damage on the right-hand side of the car. I think there's been side-to-side contact more than once on that opening lap and the pressure load behind [laugh] this seventy-two car at the position goes ab~, above the way the number three Century Motorsport car.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1173.551" endTime="1187.189">
<Sync time="1173.551"/>
[noise] Yeah, Dominic Paul there making a nice move goes into a third position there. Adam Balon, [breath] that's quite often the case around here though, isn't it Joe? It's quite a momentum circuit if you go for (()) you'll think you are going through and it doesn't work, [breath] you could lose momentum and actually end up under pressure from the cars behind.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1187.189" endTime="1205.433">
<Sync time="1187.189"/>
[noise] Yeah, exactly. I think we're seeing different characteristics of cars out there. The Lamborghini is great to go round the circuit. Whereas the &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; seems to struggle in the slow speed, but to compensate, it's better at the high speed and I think that's how he's got past (()) just a higher top speed.
<Sync time="1200.429"/>
[noise] #uh, And he's now gotten his head down. It looks like he's actually reeling in Sam De Haan also in front of him quite quickly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1205.433" endTime="1232.244">
<Sync time="1205.433"/>
[noise] In return, he's right on the tail of Ollie Wilkinson in third, so the top two are escaping as you would expect though, because they are the two silver driver combinations then. [breath] Glynn Geddie will, #uh, hand over at the pitstop, [breath] #uh, to Ryan Ratcliff whilst Tom Gamble,
<Sync time="1218.162"/>
[noise] in car number nine will hand over, [breath] #uh, to Jack Mitchell. Ollie Wilkinson in the first of, #uh, he's also actually silver car, isn't he? So the three silver entries in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three [breath] at the front of the field. Already some track limits memories (()) coming out, Graham, but it's been an entertaining start for this one.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1232.244" endTime="1257.651">
<Sync time="1232.244"/>
[noise] It has. Just to confirm the cars that are at the race, we've seen again, #uh, Richard Neary out of the race with the number eight, #uh, ABBA, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; AMG &lt;/initial&gt;, but also not making it, #uh, past that ((mottle or)) through lap one, the number seventy-five Optimum car. That car in the hands of Mike Robinson.
<Sync time="1246.297"/>
[noise] We saw Mike trying to get the car back on track, [breath] not managing that. Andrew Gordon-Colebrooke it was in a number forty-three Century racing M Four. Those three I'm afraid, early bath for all three of them.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1257.651" endTime="1293.452">
<Sync time="1257.651"/>
[noise] #uh, That's a real shame for them, but the battling continuing in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three there as Sam De Haan [breath] tries now to regroup. He's applying the pressure to Ollie Wilkinson in front of him. This is an impressive, #uh, performance so far for De Haan who is the leading Pro-Am car at the moment in the race.
<Sync time="1272.054"/>
[noise] Fourth-position overall [breath] for the championship lead. As they came into this race, [breath] seven points ahead of the teammate number seventy-two car, which, of course, has just lost that position. They're down into, [breath] #uh, sixth place now. And the &lt;initial&gt; JRM &lt;/initial&gt; Bentley,
<Sync time="1284.016"/>
[noise] #uh, of Seb Morris and Rick Parfitt are third in the points. Here's a replay of the start. [breath] ooh, Well, the &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Sport car gets elbowed off, I think, by the Balfe Motorsport Maclaren, didn't it there?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1293.452" endTime="1303.494">
<Sync time="1293.452"/>
[noise] It was three-wide, #uh, and right from the start then. Then there was a nerve to rear. Three-wide there again and this is where the Aston Martin wins and now take a look at here inside.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1303.494" endTime="1305.684">
<Sync time="1303.494"/>
[noise] ooh, [overlap] #um, What are we seeing here, Joe?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1305.684" endTime="1312.378">
<Sync time="1305.684"/>
[noise] The contact comes for him that ends his race. #uh, He's obviously concertinaed up. And then that was a lazy spin for the car in front. I didn't quite catch that one.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1312.378" endTime="1313.715">
<Sync time="1312.378"/>
[overlap] That was seventy-five, I think.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1313.715" endTime="1354.280">
<Sync time="1313.715"/>
[noise] I think so, yeah. And, #uh, whether that was assisted or not, I'm not too sure. I think it was just a bit overexuberant with the loud pedal, wasn't he? On cold tires, especially, you have to be [breath] a little bit cautious with that. #uh, ((over to)) &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four Aston Martin, that's the sixty-one example that the car ran out of Academy Motorsport.
<Sync time="1328.703"/>
[noise] All of the [breath] Aston Martins teams upgrading over the winter to this new generation, #uh, Aston Martin V eight Vantage. [cough] Back with Maxwell, we've got battle joined now for the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four lead then, because he is now on the tail [breath] of the,
<Sync time="1340.684"/>
[noise] #uh, number twenty-nine Steller Performance Audi R-eight &lt;initial&gt; LMS &lt;/initial&gt; &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four with Richard Williams. [breath] Two more different cars you couldn't really hope to see here, Joe. The Mustang [breath] seems to have an edge in certain parts of the circuit, but where does it make the overtake?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1354.280" endTime="1387.684">
<Sync time="1354.280"/>
[noise] It looks like the car's really well-balanced flat-wise. When you get the, #uh, view of it coming into the break zone, it hits the brakes. It doesn't dive at all, which is a great thing as a driver, the car keeps balanced. Looks like the car might be quite difficult to drive.
<Sync time="1365.378"/>
[noise] Maxwell's holding the steering wheel pretty unconventional position with his right hand quite low. So I don't know if it's, #uh, a bit of a beast to get in. It looks like a big, heavy car, but I'm sure he's, #uh, he's gonna be able to hustle it around. And that Audi, I think it's gonna struggle now 'cause the team's new to the car.
<Sync time="1380.268"/>
[noise] They probably haven't had a chance to do many race runs. #uh, So obviously, over a lap it's quick, but to a full race, the car will, #uh, definitely change its characteristics.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1387.684" endTime="1408.153">
<Sync time="1387.684"/>
[noise] I can tell you the answer to that is none. [laugh] [overlap] They have to no real major testing been available for the team with this car. It's been a remarkable start to their season. Scott Maxwell amongst the most in, #uh, the most experienced racers in this race.
<Sync time="1400.684"/>
[noise] Canadian, maybe not that familiar to British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; followers, but trust me, across in North America, Scott has been around since God was a lad.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1408.153" endTime="1429.52">
<Sync time="1408.153"/>
[noise] [laugh] That he and Seb Prialux, his co-driver, joint championship leaders in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four going into this weekend along with [breath] the number fifty-seven &lt;initial&gt; HHC &lt;/initial&gt; Motorsport Maclaren, which we can see, [breath] #uh, on our screen at the moment, third in the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four category.
<Sync time="1420.764"/>
[noise] Well, whilst the action of the circuit continues to rage, it has calmed down ever so slightly since the start of the race. Time, therefore, to check in with Andy Jay in the pit lane.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1429.52" endTime="1437.028">
<Sync time="1429.52"/>
[noise] Yes, I'm with Adam and, #uh, I mean, what could I say, Adam? You don't wanna see this on any race, but especially not for the first race of the weekend so early on.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk8" startTime="1437.028" endTime="1463.481">
<Sync time="1437.028"/>
[noise] Yeah, it's a real shame. I~, it looked like he got a great start off the line, managed to jump two of the cars and then, #uh, suddenly just, I think, just went a little too hot into turn two. [breath] And had contact and it's, it looks like it split the rad, so, #uh he's, he's turned it off because obviously we don't wanna damage the engine.
<Sync time="1451.002"/>
[noise] We wanna make sure that we can get out for, for race two, where we're starting fifth. [breath] #um, But yeah, obviously the boys are gonna have a bit of hard work to do, #uh, getting the bumper, radiators and a few things, #uh, squared up and, #uh, making sure we can get out for this afternoon.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1463.481" endTime="1466.519">
<Sync time="1463.481"/>
[noise] But the early expectation is you will be racing in the second race?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk8" startTime="1466.519" endTime="1480.269">
<Sync time="1466.519"/>
[noise] Yeah, that's the plan, like, (()) down like. It's, it's just a bum. It's one of them that, sadly, it's just got to the radiator and, of course, once the radiator's pierced, [breath] you've got limited time before it cooks the motor, so we just, #uh, turned it off straight away and pulled over into a safer place.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1480.269" endTime="1483.731">
<Sync time="1480.269"/>
[noise] It's the right thing to do. All [overlap] right. Thanks, Adam. Appreciate it. [overlap] Good luck. We'll see you in the next race.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1483.731" endTime="1500.197">
<Sync time="1483.731"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] #uh, That's a shame then. The car that finished second in race two in Oulton Park last time out. [breath] #uh, Joe Osborn I think was just making the point to was that actually, of course, they don't want to not finish, [breath] but they're gonna have to serve that extra seven-second penalty in the pit lane anyway,
<Sync time="1496.109"/>
[noise] so if ever there was a race for the, to not go to plan, I suppose this is the one, wasn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1500.197" endTime="1522.744">
<Sync time="1500.197"/>
[noise] Yeah, exactly and Adam's, #uh, obviously, #uh, full-time factory driver at Mercedes &lt;initial&gt; AMG &lt;/initial&gt;, but you're working with an amateur half your battle here and you're a pro with an am. He's trying to find positives and keep their head up. Richard's, #uh, a great bloke and a good driver, but spending a lot of money to be here.
<Sync time="1513.922"/>
[noise] And when you get a daft result like that, you need to try and draw some positives. And one of them is at least they won't be, #uh, losing their best result, #uh, because they did have that pitstop penalty to serve.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1522.744" endTime="1537.514">
<Sync time="1522.744"/>
[noise] And looking back (()), by the way, at that replay gave us an opportunity to up pick it. It was real, caught a real contact. #uh, Richard Neary on the rear of Mark Farmer's Aston Martin, which also, by the way, cause and effect, explains the smoke we saw from the &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; ((car)) down the race.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1537.514" endTime="1552.983">
<Sync time="1537.514"/>
[noise] [overlap] Oh, trouble. That's the nineteen Multimax at Mustang then, which had this new driver lined up this weekend. [breath] It was Alastair McKinnon who started the car and he's got a front left puncture.
<Sync time="1546.684"/>
[noise] [breath] Now I don't see any damage on the car, but we have to assume, Joe, at least in the early stage of the race, [breath] that can only surely have been comped out of the scores that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1552.983" endTime="1586.184">
<Sync time="1552.983"/>
[noise] Yeah, I think you're correct there. I couldn't see any damage in the, looked like the inside tire walls, a bit of that had failed. #uh And that is, #uh, a problem you find with racing tires. The teams wanna run the pressures as low as possible and the camber as high as possible to generate more grip.
<Sync time="1567.025"/>
[noise] The negative to that is that it normally causes a failure very similar of that. So I would maybe a bit worried if I was, #uh, Maxwell and, #uh, Multimatic car is that maybe they need to be a bit careful with their front left,
<Sync time="1578.432"/>
especially, #uh, so that they might have to start nursing the car that would be fed back to them. I'm sure that ((assisted)) cars had a failure and please think about what you're doing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1586.184" endTime="1605.907">
<Sync time="1586.184"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] Meantimes, it's still a great battle at the front of this &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four field. Still Richard Williams mirrors four of on a very full, very large Ford Mustang behind. Scott Maxwell doing all he can do to put the Audi man ahead under pressure but for the moment,
<Sync time="1599.695"/>
[noise] #uh, after missing Oulton Park, it's a very happy return to the British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; championship for Stellar.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1605.907" endTime="1644.29">
<Sync time="1605.907"/>
[noise] Yeah, it is. They're a bit wide at the apex there. They're going through Williams. So could this be Maxwell's opportunity? [breath] He's no closer though than he's been on previous laps going down the back straight. And I did notice from the onboard a lap or so ago, there's nothing in it in straight-line speed.
<Sync time="1618.322"/>
[noise] This will be the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three (()), it's the Beechdean car after each rotation on the opening lap, [breath] which, #uh, dives up [laugh] inside and [breath] left just enough room by the Mustang to, #uh, to squeeze through there, but car number nine [overlap] (()).
<Sync time="1631.514"/>
[noise] He has spun in the hairpin. [breath] Now, how has that happened? He's headbutting the, #uh, advertising wall. I think that won't damage the car, but it's certainly gonna lose him positions. He was holding onto [breath] that fourth position and attacking Ollie Wilkinson. Let's see, Joe, talk us through this.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1644.29" endTime="1675.977">
<Sync time="1644.29"/>
[noise] So, yeah, looks like Paul's had, #uh, #uh, last-minute lunge. #uh, And I don't wanna point fingers, but that's definitely his fault. [laugh] And, #uh, yeah, it's Sam De Haan didn't look like he did anything wrong at all there to me.
<Sync time="1654.105"/>
[noise] He defended his position clean and fairly and [breath] Paul, I'm sure no intent, but, #uh, I'm sure the race director's gonna have to have a look at that one, 'cause he's gained a position and Sam De Haan has lost a fair few there (()).
<Sync time="1663.848"/>
[noise] Dropped him down to just ahead of newcomers to the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three class, the eighteen, &lt;initial&gt; WPI &lt;/initial&gt; car. So that Huracan. A Huracan battle now. Well, it pumped up Sam De Haan for sure, after that. I'm sure, #um.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1675.977" endTime="1698.106">
<Sync time="1675.977"/>
[noise] Yeah, and, #uh, Graham Davidson also joining in the fun there, as well. Here's a replay from onboard with De Haan. Wait for it, bang. There he is, and he was looking, wasn't he, Joe, not to beach it that curve on the inside? We saw that happen to Mark Farmer at Oulton Park last time out.
<Sync time="1688.019"/>
[noise] Not even on the curve, just on a slightly cambered, #uh, edge of the road. #uh, He thankfully had the presence of mind to keep the car moving and he didn't get beached. Can that damage the undertray of the car, though, rattling over those curves?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1698.106" endTime="1726.493">
<Sync time="1698.106"/>
[noise] It can do, but luckily &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three cars are a flat floor, so a carbon fiber and aluminum, so actually, it's gonna dissipate the energy, at least. There's not one bit that'll rip the sump off, for example, on a normal road car. #uh, And luckily, the Lamborgini's actually an automatic clutch, so you wouldn't have stalled there.
<Sync time="1711.757"/>
[noise] It would automatically come in, so he wouldn't have stalled. And then he just buried his foot and kept it going. It was, the rate it went round, he did well not to do a full spin. #uh, Looks like, #uh, the Mustang's got a new tire and is [overlap] coming back out. It's gonna be right in the middle of this &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three battle out there, so he's gonna have to pay attention.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1726.493" endTime="1748.975">
<Sync time="1726.493"/>
[noise] That's music to the ears. I'm sure one of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three cars that are charging through. There's Rick Parfitt, he's inherited sixth place now, of course, after all of that. Shaun Balfe up into seventh place [breath] and yet De Haan rejoined in eighth position, but some way back, [breath] a couple more cars being warned for exceeding track limits.
<Sync time="1740.417"/>
[noise] Car number fifty-eight is one of them, but it's only a warning for the time being. [breath] He's definitely in the race though (()) track limits, so they'll have to, #uh, be a little bit careful. [breath]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1748.975" endTime="1761.379">
<Sync time="1748.975"/>
[noise] #uh, Glynn Geddie, meanwhile is pulling away at the front of this race. #uh, Almost eight seconds they got now from Tom Gamble, last-minute replacement here for injured, #uh, Adrian Willmot.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1761.379" endTime="1789.056">
<Sync time="1761.379"/>
[noise] Yep, and there's the other Bentley, the, #uh, team, sorry, the &lt;initial&gt; JRM &lt;/initial&gt; example [breath] of Rick Parfitt who is busy defending Shaun Balfe, but he's catching actually the, [breath] #uh, number three, Century Motorsport, &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt;. Someone kicking up the dirt. [overlap] Oh, wait, there's somebody. (()) they've got a wheel on grass turning into Hamilton
<Sync time="1775.659"/>
[noise] [breath] and that's another easy position gained for those two. They both drive through. [breath] I was about to make the suggestion that Dominic Paul may have possibly did some damage to the aerodynamics of the front of that car. I don't think he can blame aerodynamics for that one, though. It looked to me, Joe, like he just dipped the wheel on the grass turning into Hamilton.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1789.056" endTime="1806.86">
<Sync time="1789.056"/>
[noise] Yeah, unfortunately, a very common and easy mistake in a left-hand drive car. You can see how wide that &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; is, so he's got four and half, five-foot of car to his right. Only takes a couple of inches of that to be on the dirt as he turns in. And if you actually see next time, we get a shot of that corner, it's actually worn down to mud there,
<Sync time="1803.704"/>
[noise] so it's how common that happens, the grass has been [overlap] worn away.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1806.86" endTime="1824.345">
<Sync time="1806.86"/>
[noise] #uh, Taking advantage of that, but also in a battle of the road, for what is now to be fifth position, Rick Parfitt Junior, now under real pressure from Shaun Balfe.
<Sync time="1815.202"/>
[noise] This car, best of course, having rounds at Oulton Park but, #uh, but Joe, you'll be very, very familiar indeed, with the luscious lines of the McLaren seven-twenty-S.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1824.345" endTime="1871.477">
<Sync time="1824.345"/>
[noise] Yeah, I'll try not to sound biased, but, #uh, I'm going to be massively biased [laugh] about it. It's obviously a beautiful car, #um, one of the new generations of cars, along with the Bentley, but we focused massively on the development, so it's kind of got its tires and driveable. So, hopefully, as, #uh,
<Sync time="1837.656"/>
[noise] #uh, Shaun Balfe, well, Balfe will prove that over the next forty-four minutes that we've got remaining, it would continue to climb the order. I think the interesting thing for both Balfe and Arthur here, actually, they're third and second respectively, at the Pro-Am part of this &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three race.
<Sync time="1851.228"/>
[noise] So we've got Geddie, Gamble and Wilkinson in the top three on track, and they're all silver-silvers. So unfortunately, when their co-drivers get in and come out against the full gold lineup in the Pro-Am cars, they've not only got more weight, but technically, by their driving rating,
<Sync time="1864.572"/>
[noise] they should be a bit slower. So for me, this is shaping up to be a real classic race. We're going to have a lot of cars catching cars in front of them.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1871.477" endTime="1901.951">
<Sync time="1871.477"/>
[noise] Yeah, we've got astonishing quality to come in the British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; championship. We saw this last year, start to emerge, with Aston Martin throwing a lot of hats in the ring, but the thirteen cars in the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three, the last six of them would have, we've now lost Adam Christodoulou,
<Sync time="1885.651"/>
[noise] would have had factory talent, #uh, aboard that Lamborghini with Phil Keen. #uh, Rob Bell, the still ((attractiveness)) is doing remarkably (()) challenge Rob Bell,
<Sync time="1895.497"/>
[noise] #uh, a very rapid (()) McLaren three, Aston Martin factory drivers, that's when we get to the ((bar brawl)).
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1901.951" endTime="1940.16">
<Sync time="1901.951"/>
[laugh] Indeed. [breath] Leaders in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, they've worked their way down towards, Richie's caught. [overlap] Oh no, Mark, Mark Farmer [breath] has, well, let's wait and see what happened, how exactly he got there. We can see the end result.
<Sync time="1915.468"/>
[noise] There's been damage to the back of the car, which was [breath] as a result of the contact we assume on the opening lap, but that again, was down [breath] at left-hand kink at Hamilton, which is proving to be a [breath] particularly tricky part of the circuit. [breath] There, Andrew Howard, in the Beechdean car,
<Sync time="1928.934"/>
[noise] he is [breath] some way down the order, isn't he? Andrew Howard is, yes, there he is, twelfth positions, so he's the last of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three runners. Mark Farmer has spun and rejoined and he's still in front of Andrew, that's how far back he is.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1940.16" endTime="1956.794">
<Sync time="1940.16"/>
[noise] Yeah, that's, #uh, (()) courtesy of Andrew's troubles in the start of the race. [breath] He has pulled back a lot of time. There's big damage to the back of that [overlap] Aston Martin.
<Sync time="1947.16"/>
[noise] That was some hit at the start of the race, not surprising, the front end damage for the &lt;initial&gt; AMG &lt;/initial&gt;, when you look at, #uh, how badly formed the otherwise beautiful lines of that Aston Martin, huh?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="1956.794" endTime="1967.021">
<Sync time="1956.794"/>
[noise] Yeah, indeed. And, #uh, that's, I'm trying to look at where that, #er, undertray at the back and the, and the diffuser has been bent at all. I don't know, your eyes are maybe better than mine, Joe, and you know what you're looking for more than me. [breath]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="1967.021" endTime="1993.679">
<Sync time="1967.021"/>
[noise] [overlap] Well, there's definitely detrimental, #uh, performance in that diffuser. The diffuser does, #uh, like two or three times more work down course-wise, at the rear wing, #uh, so that is going to be hurting. I'm not saying that was his whole reason for spinning at Hamilton, but it definitely wouldn't have helped.
<Sync time="1981.346"/>
[noise] #uh, There's nothing the team will be able to do at the pit stop with that, maybe except throwing some tape on it, #uh, so nothing falls off it, but #uh, they're going to have to carry that all the way through the rest of this race. So I'd be interested to see what, #uh, the team can do to that car there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1993.679" endTime="2012.001">
<Sync time="1993.679"/>
[noise] Still battling hard for this lead in, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, Richard Williams is getting away here, from Scott Maxwell, and certainly, more clearer than we saw last time around and, #uh, what was tenths, now over a second.
<Sync time="2007.071"/>
[noise] The last time they crossed the line, if anything, it looks to me as if the Audi man is pulling further away.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2012.001" endTime="2051.727">
<Sync time="2012.001"/>
[noise] Behind them though, Josh Smith is now into third place, and the two McLarens have swapped positions. The [breath] Tolman car, car number four, has now had an &lt;initial&gt; HHC &lt;/initial&gt; example, [breath] a George championship lead, is Callum Pointon, [breath] back with the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three scrap for third place though.
<Sync time="2024.866"/>
[noise] And Ollie Wilkinson, [breath] unlike his fellow silver, #uh, graded drivers in front of him, Glynn Geddie and Tom Gamble, has not been able to pull any sort of a margin over the leading Pro-Am contenders, so Adam Balon, the leading am driver in this race at the moment in fourth position
<Sync time="2039.277"/>
[noise] and is really, really hurrying the Aston Martin. Now, Joe, we used to see that the older or the, the, the previous generation Aston Martin &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three car really well suited to this place, wasn't it, but this is [breath] quite a different beast altogether, isn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2051.727" endTime="2102.827">
<Sync time="2051.727"/>
[noise] Yeah, definitely. I think the biggest changes go from a naturally aspirated B-twelve to the now twin-turbo one and it's, it's, I think it looks harder to drive out of the slow corners. The turbos, they have to come in, and then the track controls have to deal with that
<Sync time="2064.669"/>
[noise] otherwise the rear tires is gonna spin-up and you're gonna lose performance. So I think that's probably where they're lacking here, #uh, in the nature of, of the circuit. So the fast, flowing stuff, they look all right. It's the tight, twisty stuff and as they come up to these &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four cars,
<Sync time="2078.034"/>
[noise] I think this is where Balon is gonna probably find his best opportunity, #uh, to close up on Ollie. He's doing a, a mega job in third position here and if he can get that car there to Brad~, #uh, ~ley Ellis in, #uh, in the pits,
<Sync time="2089.365"/>
[noise] that car, I would fancy would probably stay on the podium, to be honest, #um, but so far, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Fours seem to be pretty well behaved. None of them are in a tight, tight battle, which always makes it a bit harder to overtake someone going.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2102.827" endTime="2112.375">
<Sync time="2102.827"/>
[noise] #uh, Down the track it looks a bit confusing [laugh] [overlap] (()) it's a bit like a go-cart here, stuck in the middle, isn't it? It weaves his way in that, but then they're like ((call me out)) for a brief moment. [breath] Very close here, that's third place, Graham.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2112.375" endTime="2129.142">
<Sync time="2112.375"/>
[noise] Yeah, #uh, Ollie Wilkinson did well through traffic. Balon did better and, #um, through they come, just tenths between them.
<Sync time="2119.01"/>
[noise] Ollie Wilkinson, by the way, has been catching Tom Gamble over the last couple laps as well and ((stop-gap)) is, at worse, stable and if, #uh, if I'm right, I think that's coming down as well.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2129.142" endTime="2141.987">
<Sync time="2129.142"/>
[noise] Yeah, by four-tenths last time around, personal best lap set by Ollie Wilkinson despite the pressure. [breath] As a driver, Joe, do you get spurred on when you've got this sort of pressure behind you? Can that bring the best out of you or [breath] do you just find yourself focusing in the mirrors and losing time?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2141.987" endTime="2179.971">
<Sync time="2141.987"/>
[noise] Yeah, at least Ollie's only got one mirror, so he's not getting, #uh, distracted quite as much. #um, However, I think the, the main thing here is he's got to keep his eyes up. #uh, The cars now are so advanced, we, we have what we call the delta of the car, which is set from our fastest lap,
<Sync time="2155.266"/>
[noise] and then it's a live update if we're going faster or slower. So Ollie will just be focused on that, trying to work out where he's losing time to his best lap so far and eking it out there. And as we see, he's only tenths of a second, which is, #uh, impressive consistency,
<Sync time="2169.516"/>
[noise] but (()) pace. So, he seems to have had a pretty calm first twenty minutes I would say, Ollie, so I think he's, #uh, he's got it set down, he definitely doesn't look like he's being distracted by the charge of Balon.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2179.971" endTime="2206.427">
<Sync time="2179.971"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] #uh, There is an issue, I'm afraid, for the Century Motorsport number three car. He's been having a ten-second stop and go penalty [breath] for causing a collision. I think we all know which collision that was as well, #um, so, so the number three car will have to serve a ten-second stop-go penalty.
<Sync time="2194.583"/>
[noise] This looks rather lively, [breath] Lamborghini is at play, Barwell Motorsport versus &lt;initial&gt; WPI &lt;/initial&gt;, [breath] and the &lt;initial&gt; WPI &lt;/initial&gt; car, Michael Igoe getting stuck in here, isn't he, Graham? The first appearance of that car in the championship and they all are there inside the top ten.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2206.427" endTime="2218.595">
<Sync time="2206.427"/>
[noise] It's a, it's a Lamborghini three-car train here, because just ahead of them, Sam De Haan [breath] and these three are actually catching Shaun Balfe, albeit with some traffic to play with, but three Huracans, nose to tail, it's a V-thirty.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2218.595" endTime="2249.915">
<Sync time="2218.595"/>
[noise] [laugh] There is Dominic Paul then diving up the inside of the Track Focused, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; KTM &lt;/initial&gt; Cross-Bow or Mike McCollum running down in [breath] seventh place in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four Pro-Am at the moment, but they're twenty-ninth position overall. [breath]
<Sync time="2230.377"/>
[noise] We've got really impressive paces from Michael Igoe, in the W~, &lt;initial&gt; WPI &lt;/initial&gt;, [breath] #uh, Lamborghini. [breath] One of the key things about these &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three cars these days though, Joe, is they're very user friendly, aren't they?
<Sync time="2241.3"/>
[noise] So, [breath] whilst it's never easy to jump into a car that's going this quick, [breath] they are maybe a little bit less difficult than some other cars, just to get your head around early on.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2249.915" endTime="2290.094">
<Sync time="2249.915"/>
[noise] Yeah, a hundred percent and I made a good example of that yesterday. I was at Silverstone racing a Jaguar E type, #uh, where I had to press one of three pedals, manual gearbox, no &lt;initial&gt; AVS &lt;/initial&gt; and #uh, yeah, it focuses the mind, how difficult they are.
<Sync time="2261.228"/>
[noise] But it's a great testament to what the manufacturers have done technology-wise, with the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three, and my personal involvement, when we developed the seven-twenty-S &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; is we all know they're going to be Pro-Am mostly in this sort of championship,
<Sync time="2274.036"/>
[noise] but also ((TOP)) so we should all be doing the same lap times, which is like the pit windows open and people are diving in to get the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three window [laugh] rolling.
<Sync time="2282.113"/>
[noise] #uh, Not surprisingly, all the ams want to come in as early as they can to get their quicker pro in so, so their loss is as small as possible.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2290.094" endTime="2299.31">
<Sync time="2290.094"/>
[noise] But with the exception of two of the Lamborghinis that go (()) gone through, Glynn Geddie, [breath] #uh, he stays out. He's six-point-three seconds up now, on Tom Gamble.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2299.31" endTime="2315.508">
<Sync time="2299.31"/>
[noise] Interesting. It looks like Optimum have saved a new set of tires there, so Brad's gonna get two laps of new boots, which for me will probably run three or four seconds off.
<Sync time="2306.81"/>
[noise] It looks like, #uh, Ellis having to go on ((scrap)) tires, so, #uh, Bradley should be able to get his head down and maybe get a bit of a gap to, #uh, to Keen getting in the car.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2315.508" endTime="2367.939">
<Sync time="2315.508"/>
[noise] So change for this year in regulations means that the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three pit window opens a few minutes before the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four one. This is to try and [breath] limit the amount of congestion in the pit stops, which is [breath] a good (()) I think on safety grounds. As far as pit stop penalties are concerned,
<Sync time="2328.027"/>
[noise] if you were on the podium in race number two, at, #uh, Oulton Park last time out, [breath] you will have to spend a bit longer in the pit lane this time around. So the winners in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three last time out, at race two at Oulton, [breath] were the number sixty-nine, Barwell Motorsport Lamborghini.
<Sync time="2340.181"/>
[noise] They all, therefore, have to serve [breath] an extra ten seconds in the pit lane, on top of the [breath] minimum pit stop time that already exists. [breath] #uh, The ninety-nine Beachdean car, as if their day wasn't going badly enough, will also have to serve [breath] a five-second success penalty. [breath]
<Sync time="2353.154"/>
[noise] #uh, The, the other car that would have had to serve time in the pit lane was the [breath] Team ABBA Racing Mercedes &lt;initial&gt; AMG &lt;/initial&gt; car number eight, who was second at Oulton Park, [breath] but #uh, that is sort of irrelevant now. So, changes as they come out to the pit lane, it looks as though some teams have made a better job of that than others.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2367.939" endTime="2386.208">
<Sync time="2367.939"/>
[noise] #uh, Out ahead of the Bentley, #uh, is (()) Rob Bell now, aboard the Balfe Motorsport, [breath] #uh, Balfe Motorsport McLaren.
<Sync time="2376.208"/>
[noise] But also, the &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt;, that was one of the &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; cars that also go, gone by Bentley too, [breath] is through comes team Parker, car number seven. Low flying spitfire soundtrack.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2386.208" endTime="2463.466">
<Sync time="2386.208"/>
[noise] [laugh] It looks and sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? But it does (()) go quickly [breath] and Glynn Geddie, with this enormous lead really. It's even bigger now actually, because Tom Gamble from second place has just pitted, so the number, [breath] #uh, nine machine is in.
<Sync time="2399.856"/>
[noise] And Century Motorsport will service the car. Hand it over to Jack Mitchell and it will now be intersting to see how this dynamic changes with [breath] the pro drivers getting into the Pro-Am cars and, #uh, another silver graded driver [breath] into the silver-silver ones. There is Sam De Haan. He's in. [breath]
<Sync time="2414.624"/>
[noise] Handing over to Jonny Cocker, but as I said, they have this ten-second extra pitstop penalty to serve, so whilst they were the leading Pro-Am car [breath] before pitstops began, that now looks a little bit less likely to be the case afterwards. [breath] We have this minimum pitstop time.
<Sync time="2428.458"/>
[noise] So it will drop a huge element of rush in the pitstop. You have to be stationary or you have to pit a certain amount of time between the, [breath] #uh, pit timing lines. It's from pit in to pit out that the time is measured. [breath] So, #uh, it just means that you can go about your business a little bit more, not leisurely,
<Sync time="2442.746"/>
[noise] but there's not quite the same sense of rush. Less likely to make mistakes, I suppose. [breath] Fifty-seven Maclaren there going a lap down. They're still running third. Well, they're back into third now in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, because number four Tolma car has pitted, so, [breath] #um, the, you know, ((it counted)) them because, #uh, the,
<Sync time="2457.708"/>
[noise] #uh. No, excuse me. It's gone ahead, excuse me. So yeah, the number four car pulling away [breath] from fifty-seven &lt;initial&gt; HHC &lt;/initial&gt;.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2463.466" endTime="2477.666">
<Sync time="2463.466"/>
[noise] The work through the final, #uh, pitstops for the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three packs still to come down pit lane. Glynn Geddie, he's doing a fine job of actually keeping that lead with or without the help of the, #uh, pitstops. Trouble with the sixty-nine car. Now it gets away.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2477.666" endTime="2488.525">
<Sync time="2477.666"/>
[noise] That, that'll be the ten-seconds extra, isn't it, that they have to, #uh, to wait and it will seem like an age there, Joe. You've got the pit stop done. [breath] There's nothing else to do with the car. You're ready and waiting to go and you just wait watching that stopwatch.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2488.525" endTime="2526.033">
<Sync time="2488.525"/>
[noise] Yeah, to find ten seconds out the track is, #uh, almost impossible to, to find, so that is, super, super difficult. I think there was a pushed back into the pit lane and literally were early. The, the rule should be push back and go. I think they did affect anyone, so it's a shame if they got a penalty for that,
<Sync time="2502.888"/>
[noise] but here it's necessary with the pit lane being so small, too small. We have cars that don't even have garages have to come in at forty-five degrees is obviously a difficult position to get the car back into the pit lane safely. And it, it does seem from the outside a, a lot, lot better than having a split pit window.
<Sync time="2517.330"/>
[noise] When we have &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Threes, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Fours all at once, the safety guard comes out. You're kind of fearing for your shins getting taken out by a, a splitter of a car for most, #uh, most of the stops.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2526.033" endTime="2539.725">
<Sync time="2526.033"/>
[noise] A fabulous looking thing. #uh, The gen two Bentley Continental, Will's first [overlap] (()) country house. [overlap] (()) fantastic. The nine and the seventy-two side by side. We'll say side by side, door in door. #uh, If anything there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2539.725" endTime="2606.579">
<Sync time="2539.725"/>
[noise] I reckon this is gonna work out for about second place, isn't it, after pitstop, 'cause the number nine car, [breath] which was being driven by Tom Gamble. It now has Jack Mitchell at the wheel who's running in second position before the stops, [breath] but he's under all sorts of pressure now from car number seventy-two, Phil Keen, [breath] who is on a bit of a charge here.
<Sync time="2554.135"/>
[noise] He looks to the inside line. He, remember, [breath] is a pro driver. It's, #uh, not the silver graded driver and Jack Mitchell is at the wheel of the &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt;. And right behind him, Bradley Ellis has taken over. Another one of the silver-silver cars. [breath] That's the Optimum Motorsport's Aston Martin, which has lost the position,
<Sync time="2567.347"/>
[noise] therefore [breath] to the, #uh, Barwell Motorsport Lamborgini. [breath] This is the car that was leading the race. Now, where does that come out in relation to this trio of cars [breath] coming across the start-finish line? The &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; [breath] was in second position before the pitstops.
<Sync time="2579.729"/>
[noise] Is it still to be second place after? It'll be mighty, mighty close. I think that the &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; might go through. Yes, it will. It was not a brilliant stop there from the, #uh, Team Parker Racing squad [breath] and they will lose not one, not two, but three positions.
<Sync time="2591.815"/>
[noise] So the number seven Bentley, it didn't have any extra seconds to serve in the pit lane, either, so that's bizarre, but it does cost them an awful lot of ground. [breath] The &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; and Century Motorsport now then the leading [overlap] car, but it's pitted. But receives a bit of a tag in the tail from Phil Keen. He wants to get on with this.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2606.579" endTime="2609.72">
<Sync time="2606.579"/>
[noise] #uh, so a couple of tags in the tail from Phil Keen.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2609.72" endTime="2652.615">
<Sync time="2609.72"/>
[noise] Well, you don't need to flush your headlights (()) to show what you wanna do. [laugh] I think Phil's, #uh, giving him a love tap and then, #uh, a French kiss on the, [laugh] #uh, the second go of it, as well, so it looks like Jack is pretty, #uh, determined to keep his elbows out even though there's thirty, [laugh] #uh, one minutes left.
<Sync time="2624.325"/>
[noise] It's gonna be, #uh, a long old stint for him, #uh, for them, but mostly for, for Keen, it's gonna feel like a very quick stint every lap he can't get past. [breath] And it, it's difficult for [overlap] Phil 'cause the, #uh. Yeah, that was a good old twitch.
<Sync time="2636.524"/>
[noise] #uh, The &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt;'s so strong at the end of the straight and that's where you overtake. It doesn't really matter if you're quicker in the corner if there's a slow car in front of you, 'cause you can't do much about overtaking in the corner.
<Sync time="2646.101"/>
[noise] So Phil's really just gonna have to keep pressurizing him and hope he gets a bad exit onto one of the long straights and top speeds negated.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2652.615" endTime="2672.809">
<Sync time="2652.615"/>
[noise] [overlap] That course Phil Keen, also very, very well aware that he's got Bradley Ellis snapping on his heels. The Aston Martin two performs definitely to his Lamborghini. He wants to show where his car is the strongest and at that point, he needs to make the move.
<Sync time="2665.713"/>
[noise] There is gonna be no respite the remaining thirty-one minutes now. We've got a four-car train for the lead of this race.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2672.809" endTime="2721.551">
<Sync time="2672.809"/>
[noise] Yeah, this is fantastic stuff, isn't it? And four different manufacturers, as well [breath] as they, #uh, turn their way through ((core)). The &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four pit lane window, by the way, has just opened. Therefore, we have &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four cars [breath] in the pit lane. Suitably enough, this is the number twenty Balfe Motorsport car.
<Sync time="2685.532"/>
[noise] Graham Johnson handing over to Michael O'Brien. The Beechdean machine is in as well. I think it's Kelvin Fletcher who is doing the second stint [breath] in that one. Race leaders, though, have got to start a finish line. They go [breath] and it is going to be Jack Mitchell that leads them down towards turn one or is it? Phil Keen having a look to the inside.
<Sync time="2699.743"/>
[noise] [breath] Can't quite do it. Ryan Ratcliffe though in fourth place is looking like he's closing in, as well. [breath] #uh, The Balfe car, so &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four didn't escape the, #uh, fisticuffs in the early stages (()). They did a bit of damage there on the Balfe car. [breath] This is sensational racing, though, isn't it?
<Sync time="2713.320"/>
[noise] But Joe, this is a difficult position for Phil Keen to be in. [breath] He wants to attack. He wants to get into the race lead, but again, he's so precariously placed. He could end up losing ground.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2721.551" endTime="2742.638">
<Sync time="2721.551"/>
[noise] Yeah, that's the thing. A &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; struggles with traction, but soon as it gets to that third gear range, it seems superior. I think Phil's best chance is actually here into turn four. Not this lap, but [breath] he's got such a, oh, Brad's had a good look as well, there.
<Sync time="2733.82"/>
[noise] So, as you said earlier, (()), [breath] Phi's in the difficult position of in the middle. You wanna get past, but also y~, if he loses the position to Brad, he's even farther away from where he wanted to be.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2742.638" endTime="2762.73">
<Sync time="2742.638"/>
[noise] But while this is happening, that four-car train has become a five-car train, but it's catching the Bentley now as in comes the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four leader, Richard Williams after the fabulous stint to lead the race. Almost from the start, the twenty-nine Audi. He's got Maxwell pulled aside, [breath] but, #uh,
<Sync time="2756.012"/>
[noise] but then Rob Bell has caught, #uh, Ryan Ratcliffe now and that's now back to the fourth place behind this battle for first.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2762.73" endTime="2802.093">
<Sync time="2762.73"/>
[noise] Not a bad a debut in the championship with the new Maclaren, is it? This is in fifth position and right in the thick of the battle. We've got Jonny Adam in the forty-seven Aston Martin only a second and a half further back as well. [breath] We're gonna have the entire &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three field together here, I think, fighting for the lead before too much longer.
<Sync time="2775.738"/>
[noise] [breath] And this is why Phil Keen is really got the hurry up here. He wants to get through [breath] and get clear of this (()). The (()) hole, though, is not to the overtake opportunity, [breath] so he ducks back in line. The tight line in though means he's a bit slow off the corner [breath] and Bradley Ellis with his headlights ablaze is,
<Sync time="2789.602"/>
[noise] [breath] #uh, ready to apply the [laugh] pressure. Look at this. This is fantastic stuff. And Phil Keen with a big twitch as he comes through the, #uh, [breath] right-hander at core. That Lamborgini's usually so poised and well-balanced. [breath] That shows how hard he's pushing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2802.093" endTime="2816.804">
<Sync time="2802.093"/>
[noise] And we talked earlier in the, #uh, in the race about balanced performance. Working pretty well here. Five very, very different cars in the top five. Car ninety-six, though, is going to get a stop and go penalty. That's bad, bad news for Bradley Ellis.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2816.804" endTime="2827.798">
<Sync time="2816.804"/>
[noise] Yeah, third place, but they won't be after that. They'll have to come into the pit late. Stop for a second and then go with a change for the race lead, Phil Keen has got through. There was a mistake though. I think, or either an [overlap] issue. [breath] Oh, there's an issue. What a shame that is for Jack Mitchell. Is that #uh.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2827.798" endTime="2844.019">
<Sync time="2827.798"/>
[noise] [overlap] The tires look okay. It looks maybe like a steering arm or something even bigger than that, 'cause that has got no power or, or no direction change from him. That's, #uh, that's a big shame for him personally, but I think that's gonna open up this &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three battle now.
<Sync time="2841.214"/>
[noise] It's gonna be interesting to see, #uh, who's in the wrong position.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2844.019" endTime="2874.255">
<Sync time="2844.019"/>
[noise] It just stopped, didn't it? [overlap] It was out at the corner. That is bizarre indeed and, #uh, well, this is one of the things, of course, with these new cars is, #uh, #uh, certain, #uh, early season gremlins potentially.
<Sync time="2856.644"/>
[noise] Now remember, that the, [breath] #uh, well, that was the race leader in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four in the pit lane. That was the Audi, but the Mustang, because it's a silver car, [breath] in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, they have to serve an extra, I think it's fifteen seconds, isn't it, in the pit lane, as well as carrying, [breath] #uh, extra ballast, as well.
<Sync time="2870.567"/>
[noise] [breath] In &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three, they just give them the ballast. There's no extra pitstop time to be served.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2874.255" endTime="2889.870">
<Sync time="2874.255"/>
[noise] Which is interesting, 'cause I thought the gut between, #uh, Balon and Wilkinson was very similar to when Ellis and Keen left.
<Sync time="2880.447"/>
[noise] So it shows you how close that too short a pitstop must've been for, for Ellis and Optimum, because obviously Balon and Keen haven't had a penalty. #uh, So it must've been tens of a second.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2889.870" endTime="2903.081">
<Sync time="2889.870"/>
[noise] That has all the hallmarks of something electrical, doesn't it, because there's no smoke. There's no damage. There's nothing falling off the car. It just stopped going and that is, [breath] #uh, going to be concerning for them, because [overlap] if it is an electrical problem.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2903.081" endTime="2904.143">
<Sync time="2903.081"/>
[noise] The light's off.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2904.143" endTime="2912.293">
<Sync time="2904.143"/>
[noise] He's doing a master reset, so he'll be in, in contact with the engineer or have, basically, the crisis sheet that &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; produced on what to do with what problems. [breath]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2912.293" endTime="2916.967">
<Sync time="2912.293"/>
[noise] And he picks up the momentum [overlap] again, immediately. In comes Bradley Ellis for that penalty.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2916.967" endTime="2961.141">
<Sync time="2916.967"/>
[noise] Yes, which means that Phil Keen now leads the race and I reckon Ryan Ratcliffe's second. Yes, he is, the Ryan Ratcliffe in the number seven, [breath] #uh, Bentley is starting to creep back into this and, so, too, Seb Morris just behind, [breath] #uh, Jonny Adam there.
<Sync time="2929.067"/>
[noise] So Jonny Adam is fourth position in the forty-seven Aston Martin [breath] and Seb Morris in the car that was started by Rick Parfitt from, [breath] toward the back of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three grid [breath] is slowly, but surely putting itself back into contention, as well. But winners, remember, [breath] of the season opener at Oulton Park
<Sync time="2943.466"/>
[noise] [breath] and then Rick was [breath] in a similar sort position, position too as that of Seth Morris now. He was inside the top five after a late safety car restart and had a spin (()), which, [breath] #uh, put him in the barriers. Despite that, though, it was a positive start to the season [breath] for the &lt;initial&gt; JRM &lt;/initial&gt; ((spot)).
<Sync time="2957.408"/>
[noise] They certainly have been the better weekend [breath] than the Team Parker, for example.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2961.141" endTime="2980.321">
<Sync time="2961.141"/>
[noise] The fastest lap of the race goes to Phil Keen. That's him around the one forty-nine, one five one. [breath] All of a sudden, #uh, we've got Rob Bell, again more urgently looking now for a way past the Bentley that puts, #uh, a rear wheel in the dirt there just briefly.
<Sync time="2974.013"/>
[noise] Twenty-two car looking racey, but he needs to, because right behind him, he's got Jonny Adam.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="2980.321" endTime="2986.431">
<Sync time="2980.321"/>
[noise] [overlap] I think in all, of course, see Phil Keen escape the car there, Joe, and that will mean that they want to get on with this and go after him.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="2986.431" endTime="3007.836">
<Sync time="2986.431"/>
[noise] Yeah, Bell's, #uh, in a similar position to what Keen was a few laps ago. Instead of there being Mitchell, it's now, #uh, Ratcliffein the, in the mi~, #uh, in the Bentley, sorry. With that extra weight for being a silver-silver, which really it hampers the car and
<Sync time="2998.898"/>
[noise] #uh, Rob's gonna try and get passed as quickly as possible, because otherwise Jonny Adam and Seb Morris won't, #uh, have much patience with him and want to take his position from him.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3007.836" endTime="3022.822">
<Sync time="3007.836"/>
[noise] Jack Mitchell by the way after that reset is back up to speed it seems certainly for the moment. So, absolutely spot on there, Joe Osborn, that was full reset and back into the fray. #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four meanwhile getting back into the stride for those cars.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3022.822" endTime="3050.665">
<Sync time="3022.822"/>
[noise] Yeah, we're still waiting for the leading few cars to complete their pit-stops and therefore the [breath] (()) to update. We are riding on board here with Seb ((Prehep)), [breath] son of three-time World Touring Car Champion, Andy. [breath] And, #uh, as they drop down
<Sync time="3036.433"/>
[noise] into the braking zone and Wilson he's got the (()) car in the out field the, [breath] #uh, Ford Mustang in front which has been [breath] taken over by Aran Tailor-Smith another former World Touring Car star. There's the second multi-matic machine serving it's pit-stop.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3050.665" endTime="3063.257">
<Sync time="3050.665"/>
[noise] Remember this is the one that had the problem with puncher earlier. [overlap] So, we'll be further back down that's, #uh, it's been different I think, gotta be in that car isn't it? Second stint, [breath] #uh, if ever there was a driver who knows this place well, it's gonna be Ben. [breath]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3063.257" endTime="3101.013">
<Sync time="3063.257"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] Yes indeed and, #uh, let's see what they can, #uh, salvage from this race that now I guess [breath] traffic over the, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four variety here for our &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three second place battle. [breath] And Ryan Radcliffe, hanging on well here hasn't yet made a mistake.
<Sync time="3077.911"/>
[noise] [breath] He is a [laugh] driver that, #uh, we saw made that mistake at Oulton Park where he maybe had a chance to fight for the race lead in the early stages. [breath] But here, this weekend, he's been a much more sure performance so far and under intense pressure. [breath] #uh,
<Sync time="3091.162"/>
[noise] It's so difficult to explain isn't it Joe just how difficult it is, this is for a driver. Not only is he trying to fend off some of the world's best &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; racers. He's also trying to pick his way through the slower traffic as well.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3101.013" endTime="3141.518">
<Sync time="3101.013"/>
[noise] Yeah, it's really where it starts to push your mental capacity. And, #uh, Ryan who is a brilliant driver, but he's not doing this as much as the guys behind him. So he doesn't get the opportunity to be in the race car two or three days a week like the guys behind him.
<Sync time="3113.898"/>
[noise] And that, that makes it difficult it's no different to exercising your, your muscles, your brain is one and if you're not doing something as much it is more difficult to keep that concentration level up. And as you eluded to the pressure is immense. And like we said,
<Sync time="3126.922"/>
[noise] you just got to keep your eyes forwards do your own thing, check your mirror once in a while, just to make sure that they're not gaining massively at one corner. You can maybe think about changing something there to stop that, #uh, hurting you as much, but he's doing an absolutely perfect job so far.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3141.518" endTime="3183.786">
<Sync time="3141.518"/>
[noise] Fantastic form now ((back with the)) still there for second. Think back by the way up through the field and making time through the Aston Martin, #uh, racing, #uh, factory drivers. Nicky Teen now back up into ninth position couple of positions back,
<Sync time="3155.68"/>
[noise] ((Marco Surronson)) #uh, there in the number two, the number ninety-nine Aston Martin respectively, but the action really is right here, it's about whether or not Rob Bell in this debuting, remember, #uh, McLaren seven-twenty-S &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three.
<Sync time="3168.861"/>
[noise] Problems meant the team did not get the car out to race in Oulton Park. It's, #uh, challenging with the, #uh, the with the (()) Bentley for second position. #uh, Can he do something when they're in traffic here?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3183.786" endTime="3197.786">
<Sync time="3183.786"/>
[noise] Well they're working their way pass some &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four traffic. The &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four category that was being led [breath] before the pit-stop by the new to the championship Audi R eight &lt;initial&gt; LNS &lt;/initial&gt;, Richard Williams was at the wheel for the first stint [breath] and now he's down in the pit-lane with Andy.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="3197.786" endTime="3206.785">
<Sync time="3197.786"/>
[noise] Yes, he certainly is able to answer some questions about we were all wondering how the R-eight would fair in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt;. Richard if that's anything to go by, very, very well indeed.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk9" startTime="3206.785" endTime="3238.979">
<Sync time="3206.785"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] Yeah, I mean it's a complete journey into the unknown for us really. I mean that car was, you know, box fresh that I, #uh, picked up kinda ten day ago. And, #um, we just didn't have a, didn't know what we were gonna be in for there. I was [breath] obviously after qualifying yesterday
<Sync time="3220.020"/>
[noise] and you know, we knew we were in a good position to be able to capitalize on that. And, [breath] you know it's a relatively clean start and I got a bit lucky with a, with a few instance up ahead. And, #uh, got into the lead and then it was about just being driving consistently and, [breath] and just seeing where we were.
<Sync time="3232.936"/>
[noise] Because we just didn't, genuinely didn't know where we were gonna end up there, so, [breath] very pleasantly surprised I have to say.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="3238.979" endTime="3243.119">
<Sync time="3238.979"/>
[noise] I mean it's, it's delightful to watch, of course, you do realize you've now put a target on your back didn't you?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk9" startTime="3243.119" endTime="3255.806">
<Sync time="3243.119"/>
[noise] [laugh] I don't mind that happy to be in that position to be perfectly honest. But, #um, I mean just, just being here and you know and being at Snetterton, in particularly it's, #uh, it's always been a kind place for me and, #uh, fingers crossed Danny could bring it home.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="3255.806" endTime="3259.768">
<Sync time="3255.806"/>
[noise] Good luck Will, enjoy watching the rest of the race, cheers mate. [overlap]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3259.768" endTime="3320.609">
<Sync time="3259.768"/>
[noise] [breath] Well there we go let's see whether or not they can hang on now. The twenty-nine car being driven by Sennan Fielding now in the second stint. There's still a fairly comfortable class lead. They've got about a thirteen second advantage [breath] over former (()) &lt;initial&gt; UK &lt;/initial&gt;, (()), star James Darwin in the number four (()) car which is second.
<Sync time="3274.736"/>
[noise] [breath] Micheal Broadhurst in that number seventy-seven Mercedes is being classified third moment in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four. They did this in Oulton Park, didn't they? They sort of came out of nowhere after the pit-stops, remember that, because over half of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four here are silver cars.
<Sync time="3288.659"/>
[noise] [breath] That means that the pro-am cars really do gain an awful lot to the pit-stop. Because the silver cars have the extra fifteen seconds that they will serve in the pit-lane. [breath] And so, the seventy-seven [lipsmack] top motor sport Mercedes of [breath] Mike Broadhurst
<Sync time="3301.159"/>
[noise] and Mark (()), [breath] they have gained an awful lot of ground through this pit-stop window. [breath] Oh there is the gap between the top two in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four. That's James Dawling in the number four car and there, the black and green car behind [breath] is Michael Broadhurst in the Mercedes.
<Sync time="3313.89"/>
[noise] Then it is, #uh, number fifty-eight next in line, so that's actually going to be, #uh, the first of the two &lt;initial&gt; HAC &lt;/initial&gt; cars isn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3320.609" endTime="3326.988">
<Sync time="3320.609"/>
[noise] Yeah and after that things start to get very tight indeed, three, four, five cars in contention for that position.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3326.988" endTime="3333.216">
<Sync time="3326.988"/>
[noise] [overlap] Fifty-seven have lost out as will, haven't they? Sorry, #uh, Graham they, they didn't have any s~, pit-stop penalty to serve. Yet they've lost about four spots. [lipsmack]

[noise] Yeah, the sixty-six car is there as well. That's Scott Malvern who is having a, [breath] #uh, decent run, He's currently eighteenth place overall, which works out of two, three, four, five, sixth place in the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four. [breath]

<Sync time="3383.367"/>
[noise] It's not gonna affect the result terribly much, because of course they have that, #uh, issue with the puncture earlier, but it's been ((left for second)) stop go for Ben who has just left the pit lane. After his, #uh, after taking a car over.

[noise] fourth position out right, when he came across the start-finish line he was twenty-eight one thousandth of a second behind Rob Bell. [breath] I think they may have been side by side into the first corner, but then McLaren had held on to the position.

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3417.85" endTime="3445.155">
<Sync time="3417.85"/>
[noise] Yeah, exactly and that gives you, #uh, that little bit of breather you need mentally, #uh, just to relax make sure your hands on (()) take a couple of deep, deep breaths and refocus your mind and kinda looking, #uh, just how long is left. I like to work out how many laps left
<Sync time="3431.754"/>
[noise] and kinda get a feel for how the car is handling breaks and tires. Can I push is a hundred percent? Or do I need to bring it back and look after the car and make sure the tires don't fall off performance-wise as the, #uh, (()) goes back into the garage have a problem.

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3445.155" endTime="3454.75">

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3454.75" endTime="3482.113">
<Sync time="3454.75"/>
[noise] A very clean looking machine though, isn't it? It, #uh, had a sixth and third-place finish at Oulton Park last time out, their first ever outright &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four class podium it was.

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="3482.113" endTime="3489.786">

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3512.136" endTime="3531.818">
<Sync time="3512.136"/>
[noise] Yeah, we unfortunately have got Rob Bell off the road with I think a right rare puncture, which we assuming came from a fairly hefty wack [breath] down to the first corner of (()). [breath]
<Sync time="3521.905"/>
Rob Bell from third position, that is [breath] devastating news to the Bell Motor Sport squad who were [breath] so close to that fairy-tale result work there, Graham. Sadly not today.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3531.818" endTime="3554.022">
<Sync time="3531.818"/>
[noise] Well, let's watch again here what happens there is the McLaren to the outside. [overlap] It was contact with another McLaren unfortunately with the &lt;initial&gt; HHC &lt;/initial&gt; cars the fifty-eight car that's caused and immediate right-rare puncture.
<Sync time="3544.145"/>
[noise] And actually Rob is lucky at that point that it wasn't starting to actually damage the (()) body work, 'cause, and actually he's, he's being very careful he clearly saw that, that's just really unfortunate.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3554.022" endTime="3562.738">
<Sync time="3554.022"/>
[noise] That looked to me Joe as though Rob didn't realize that, #uh, Seb Morris was on the inside of the other McLaren and therefore there wasn't really as much room as he was hoping.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3562.738" endTime="3592.243">
<Sync time="3562.738"/>
[noise] Yeah, I would actually like to see the replay from earlier. Because it looked like Adam was already in front of, #uh, [overlap] [lipsmack] Rob into term one and obviously, that has been a change in position and all that traffic. I was just wondering if Rob had been, #uh, held back down the straight.
<Sync time="3574.647"/>
[noise] For me as a racing incident it wasn't anyone's fault, #uh, I can see why Seb put the car [overlap] there down on the inside.
<Sync time="3580.93"/>
[noise] Yeah, [overlap] so he's ((had to)) he's had to check up and then obviously Jonny has got the run, but then Seb has got the same momentum over Rob. Also the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four car, #um is, is three into one.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3592.243" endTime="3603.396">
<Sync time="3592.243"/>
[noise] [overlap] Great, great pick, I mean basically, Rob just choose the wrong line through, didn't he, it was, it, it, it, #uh, dealt with the first those McLa~, the McLaren &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four cars, don't think realize his way was blocked on the second one.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3603.396" endTime="3607.54">
<Sync time="3603.396"/>
[noise] Yeah, I think it's a tendency even here at Snetterton we hope the people over the pit straight.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3607.54" endTime="3613.967">
<Sync time="3607.54"/>
[noise] Oh, just contact there on the pit (()). That's the [laugh] (()) just takes the nose of the second (()) car.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3613.967" endTime="3635.986">
<Sync time="3613.967"/>
[noise] [laugh] So, #uh, sorry I was saying we se~, we tend to sit next to the pitt-bull for our own benefit as we see (()) to stop the car. So, he's, he's doing everything he can. He's going as slowly as possible.
<Sync time="3624.651"/>
[noise] The tire didn't look like it was doing anymore damage. The problem here we think now is I've got another race in a [overlap] few hours. If I need another thirty minutes to fix it I need to get it back, but it looks like Balf have made the call to park the [overlap] car.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3635.986" endTime="3668.358">
<Sync time="3635.986"/>
[noise] Right, that's team manager David Balf just put the headset on there and sitting next to him, #um, #uh, on the left of our picture. That's Lee Penn, the race engineer looking very serious face there and they would have told him this, this not worth the risk at this point. You're exactly right, Drew.
<Sync time="3649.938"/>
[noise] [overlap] It's, it's difficult for Roberson, I think he's had to go left of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four cars, 'cause they naturally stay right. Then as they flew over the racing line he's, he's got that, he saw, it's just gone
<Sync time="3659.872"/>
[noise] and then it's all concertinaed up and, #uh, I hope it's, #uh, he's looked to a racing instinct. So, I wouldn't like to point any blame at anyone though in that instance.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3668.358" endTime="3680.279">
<Sync time="3668.358"/>
[noise] Yeah, certainly no malice (()) just (()) would go really and, #uh, [breath] well what a shame. That, was, looked like being a brilliant result for them, the good news Graham though the car is quick. If they get it [overlap] fixed goes back in the mix again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3680.279" endTime="3693.883">
<Sync time="3680.279"/>
[noise] Very encouraging start to the race meeting for (()) Motorsport. #uh, Say it's three to one, the problem was it was five into one, because it was the other two guys at the inside that made that all kinda ((concertinaed out)) in the wrong part of the track for Rob.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3693.883" endTime="3698.229">
<Sync time="3693.883"/>
[noise] Yeah, I'm never really very good at mathematics, so, [laugh] #uh, (()) result. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3698.229" endTime="3713.045">
<Sync time="3698.229"/>
[noise] We'll take your word for that one, Graham. [laugh] [breath] So, Bill Keenan with this enormous lead now over what is [laugh] still a fairly tight battle for second place. Because Ryan Ratcliffe [breath] may have lost the McLaren from his wing bearers, but he's gained at Jonny Adam. And that is probably not good news for Ryan Ratcliffe is it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3713.045" endTime="3734.987">
<Sync time="3713.045"/>
[noise] Well that's the second place battle, #um, behind them you can just see the rare of the Audi there that's the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four leader. That gap is coming down a little under twelve seconds now, but it's still a big gap for the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four guys.
<Sync time="3725.191"/>
[noise] This though is the major battle on track. Second place, #uh, overall Ryan Ratcliffe trying to hold off Jonny Adam with Sam Morris right in their wing mirrors as well.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3734.987" endTime="3762.638">
<Sync time="3734.987"/>
[noise] I don't know if Serge maybe got a little bit of damaged on that contact, 'cause he looked like he was the, the fastest of the group. And now it looks like he's just struggling to hang on the back of it. [breath] The Bentley is obviously a massively aerodynamic, #uh, car. You can see the front end or the turning (())
<Sync time="3748.934"/>
[noise] and if he's just lost maybe a couple of dive plates on his front left corner. Maybe (()) steer which then in turn hurts the tire even more. So, I might be wrong and he might get on the back of these guys again but he, #uh, just seems to be [overlap] a little bit off the pace to what he was at the start of this stint.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3762.638" endTime="3784.987">
<Sync time="3762.638"/>
[noise] Yeah, he'll be (()) today by seeing this battle that's developing in front my, between, #uh, Ryan and [breath] Jonny. Jonny Adam looking for a, a decent result here for &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Ra~, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; Sport after they have that really (()) stuff that disastrous Oulton Park.
<Sync time="3777.213"/>
[noise] The number forty-seven car had a best finish of seven in race one [breath] and, #uh, let's not talk about what happened to number two car. They really had a day to forget.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3784.987" endTime="3829.122">
<Sync time="3784.987"/>
[noise] Also behind this battle, cracking battle for seventh position now Nicky Teen, right with Brentley Ellis, so off to them, Motorsport, Aston Martin fending off a &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; car. #uh,
<Sync time="3795.929"/>
[noise] That is around the second last time through but, #uh, Nicky Team taking (()) out on every single sector on board now though. #uh, The forty-seventh car with Jonny Adam doing what he can. It's a great tempo here with a difference in performance.
<Sync time="3810.115"/>
[noise] Where the performance comes different parts of the track from these two packages. A huge Bentley ahead, but very very quick in a straight line. (()) with the Aston Martin, but then behind Tim Morris, but he's got a second window I think,
<Sync time="3823.859"/>
[noise] getting back with that battle. [overlap] I think you're right though Joe, I think he did just drop back a bit, didn't he?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3829.122" endTime="3855.367">
<Sync time="3829.122"/>
[noise] Yeah it might, it might even be intentional he need to make clear, #uh, keep the tentacle and sometimes it's, you find it easier when you are the momentum guy. If you catch him and pass him straight away, it's okay. If you get stuck in the battle doing the same pace as the guy in front you,
<Sync time="3842.672"/>
[noise] you suddenly lose that impetus you had to get past him and it's sometimes a difficult. ((Serge)) got no one behind him relatively so he has got that (()). He might have just said, you know what I'm gonna take two laps, cool very thing down, bring the tires down a bit and then I'm gonna really push off.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3855.367" endTime="3868.119">
<Sync time="3855.367"/>
[noise] And now looking really racy, but, #uh, so too is Jonny Adam, he's looking for a way past Ryan Ratcliffe, but [laugh] which is gonna come out [breath] to the four from these three? Two Bentley and Aston Martin walked into a bar, [laugh] there's a punch line somewhere.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="3868.119" endTime="3899.785">
<Sync time="3868.119"/>
[noise] #uh, [overlap] Oh, this is the chance I think, is it? No, not quite enough traction on the inside there but, #uh, Ryan Ratcliffe not making friends with the Apex and all he's now free, Williams [breath] and then the Bentley takes up. Look at [laugh] that acceleration out of the corner
<Sync time="3881.612"/>
[noise] [breath] and, #uh, I mean from this angle (()) it looks like the Bentley has got enormous advantage, but as we've seen of other areas of circuit the Aston Martin is stronger. [breath]
<Sync time="3890.131"/>
[noise] Oh, Seb Morris try to take advantage of that Bentley ((grim)) to get along sides, #uh, Jonny Adam (()), it wasn't quite close enough. And now, we're into the part of the circuit that should suit the Aston Martin.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3899.785" endTime="3914.439">
<Sync time="3899.785"/>
[noise] But that's the point, isn't it? We saw what Ryan Ratcliffe was doing in front of Jonny Adam, [breath] clearly Seb Morris is doing exactly the same behind. And that means that Jonny is out. (()) #uh, boys it's, it's gonna, between attack and defense, it's an [laugh] awful place for him to be right now.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3914.439" endTime="3948.967">
<Sync time="3914.439"/>
[noise] Yeah, I don't think he's gonna be enjoying this drink he's having with [laugh] (()) to be honest, 'cause he's, #uh, he's having to buy the drink and, #uh, I don't think he's getting throw back in his face (()), right? So, I think, #uh, he's just gonna have to hope that Ryan makes a little mistake like he did, #uh, how easily he can make there the traction.
<Sync time="3928.997"/>
[noise] Tha~, that Bentley it certainly has got, #uh, a good amount of boost coming out of these straights. Feels like in a &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, Aston onboard watching the come out of a (()). It's a huge amount of (()) I think Seb's trying to own, #uh, Jonny Adam.
<Sync time="3942.285"/>
[noise] Which, #uh, I'll pay a lot of money to see if Jonny bolt on the [laugh] approach here with, #uh, his vast experience and his #uh, mental (()).
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="3948.967" endTime="3962.871">
<Sync time="3948.967"/>
[noise] Absolutely full factory drive for Aston Martin, (()) winner for Aston Martin vast experience. #uh, With record-breaking experience in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Championship. Great battle meanwhile between Mustang and McLaren.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="3962.871" endTime="4001.226">
<Sync time="3962.871"/>
[noise] [overlap] The Mustang is a lap down as well so he gets out the way nicely and that's really good by, #uh, (()) not getting in the way. It just, they just they come out in the five car and Mulvin and the Mercedes (()) have damage on the front. I don't think it's from an incident together,
<Sync time="3975.754"/>
[noise] but [breath] it potentially looks like the bodywork could come off on both. The, the McLaren is a bit further back and the arch or the bonnet of the, #uh, of the Mercedes is trapping the air. And [breath] I've had it before where you got a damaged front end and the bonnet pins give up and the bonnet comes over the windscreen.
<Sync time="3989.853"/>
[noise] Ad it is one of the biggest shock you'll ever receive in your life. I could have played pop-up-pirates (()) [laugh]. So, so hopefully they, they stuck down and they don't come up but, #uh, there's definitely a bit of damage on both of those cars.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4001.226" endTime="4047.411">
<Sync time="4001.226"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] Oh, this is the fight for fourth position in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, Jordon Collard [breath] has it but, #uh, Scott McLaughlin wants it and he's almost within range of taking it. In fact, I think they're catching [breath] some of the cars in front potentially as well.
<Sync time="4014.053"/>
[noise] Yes, Michael Broadhurst on the previous lap there were four (()) and there are only, [breath] #um, how far behind? One point two seconds back in start of the lap. The number three (()) &lt;initial&gt; BMW &lt;/initial&gt; [breath] putting a lap on them [breath] after their, #uh,
<Sync time="4026.591"/>
[noise] issues earlier on there down in ninth position in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three [breath] and will now put another lap on the number nineteen Ford Mustang. It's developing quite nicely here into a battle for the bottom step, [breath] #uh, of the podium,
<Sync time="4037.776"/>
[noise] [breath] sadly, #um, (()) they just had their issues earlier on of the, they just race, racing #uh, Jaguar. We'll see more of them a little bit later on.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4047.411" endTime="4062.376">
<Sync time="4047.411"/>
[noise] Yeah, it looks like Broadhurst is really struggling now with, #uh, performance in that car. 'Cause they're really reeling them in and I think we're probably gonna go at least three laps, maybe four race laps. These &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four guys and I think as you've quite rightly said, this, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four podium is gonna get pretty tasty quite quickly.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4062.376" endTime="4096.751">
<Sync time="4062.376"/>
[noise] It's just here, meanwhile three car battle now. This is Bradley Ellis and Nicky Teen, catching on (()) for sixth position, this is the, you've introduced, #uh, the, (()), the newest of the three (()) we've got here.
<Sync time="4077.118"/>
[noise] (()) car with a ninety-six and a two we'd be watching Nicky Teen catching Bradley Ellis. #uh, Brad's been doing a great job defending that off, and it's well as you were further up the field to two, three car battle for significant positions in this race.
<Sync time="4091.953"/>
[noise] With what, #uh, just over seven minutes to go. It's been all action, hasn't it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4096.751" endTime="4119.549">
<Sync time="4096.751"/>
[noise] Oh, Seb Morris is right behind Jonny Adam, with all this, #uh, Bentley straight we know that, #uh, the Bentley appropriately enough is very strong in this part of the circuit. [breath] Will this be Seb's opportunity to attack?
<Sync time="4107.947"/>
[noise] Let's see he's in this (()) the big Bentley towering over [breath] the Aston Martin, he can't draw alongside though, can he? So, maybe that's the (()) that Jonny is getting that's helping him out a bit, but it's not a huge deficit he's got there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4119.549" endTime="4132.847">
<Sync time="4119.549"/>
[noise] We're running out of time to do it, but now catching him again is Jonny Cocker, Jonny Cocker in fifth place [breath] with over a second quicker last time around from the trio ahead. So if Jonny Cocker is getting in, in amongst this that changes the dynamic again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4132.847" endTime="4170.229">
<Sync time="4132.847"/>
[noise] #uh, Jonny has taken the remember he had that ten second extra pit-stop penalty. He was in front of these (()) in front of two of these cars at least before the pit-stops. [breath] So he's done a really great job to, [breath] #uh, overall.
<Sync time="4143.359"/>
[noise] The vast majority of that deficit and yeah, we'll see what that gap is as they, #uh, come across the start finish line this time. Bill Keen is about to be just thirteen point eight seconds over the scrap that Ratcliffe, Adam, and Morris separated by less than a second the three of them.
<Sync time="4155.7"/>
[noise] [breath] Jonny Cocker one point seven seconds back from the previous lap. Look at the time that he took out of them, comes in at one forty-nine, nine. He's by far the fastest driver on the track, [breath] compare that to the [breath] low one-minute fifty-twos that the cars in front of him was doing. [breath] He's gonna be there within a lap or so.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4170.229" endTime="4187.569">
<Sync time="4170.229"/>
[noise] Absolutely, it's all about the fact that having to attack and defend the head. Jonny Cocker meanwhile just got to focus on the three cars ahead of him.
<Sync time="4177.979"/>
[noise] He's doing that he's doing that massively well and it is gonna be a four-car battle before very much longer. There is Jonny Cocker, just beyond the Cayman.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4187.569" endTime="4208.94">
<Sync time="4187.569"/>
[noise] He's actually the slowest sort of defensive driver around to have to adopt to as well. He's stopping it in the corner so Jonny can't get around and then he's fast through the end of the straight where as the other way if you're defending at the end of the straight closing the door.
<Sync time="4199.791"/>
[noise] Sometimes don't really use that much time so it's gonna be difficult for, #uh, for them not to get caught by Jonny who's on cue, only about five minutes of the back of ((Horace)) now.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4208.94" endTime="4226.011">
<Sync time="4208.94"/>
[noise] [lipsmack] Well, we've seen one Aston Martin really struggling here in the podium battle in the hands of Jonny Adam. [breath] One Aston Martin in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three, that's not had, #uh, they drew ever so far though, is the Beechdean car, Marco Sorensen is in it now. #uh,
<Sync time="4220.567"/>
[noise] But perhaps Andrew Howard can shed some light on just why they're having such a difficult day.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4226.011" endTime="4235.297">
<Sync time="4226.011"/>
[noise] Yeah, Andrew, they've just been saying, y~, you know, Aston's usually pretty good around here, for some reason, we know that you and Marco, great racers, is there, is there something going with the car?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk11" startTime="4235.297" endTime="4274.077">
<Sync time="4235.297"/>
[noise] #um, Well, mine was, #uh, there was quite a lot of contact first corner and then big contact in front of me, second corner, windscreen filled with oil which is never a good sign. #um, so the car just went round on me, and then it took two or three laps to get it clean,
<Sync time="4249.892"/>
[noise] then you're behind the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Fours, so et cetera, et cetera, but once we got going, lap times were okay. [breath] I think, #um, without being too political, I think when you watch the Astons coming up, first phase acceleration coming up some of the corners,
<Sync time="4262.589"/>
[noise] you'll see we, we just haven't got that low down ((grunt)) at the moment. #um, And, y~, you know, they've always bought the Championship well so we'll leave it to them and they'll do a good job, but at the moment, we're just, we're just struggling on that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4274.077" endTime="4276.937">
<Sync time="4274.077"/>
[noise] You gonna make any setup changes in the break?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk11" startTime="4276.937" endTime="4300.544">
<Sync time="4276.937"/>
[noise] #um, [laugh] Yeah, well (()) don't get behind in the whole &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four (()). #um, No, I, I, I think the car is a pretty good race car if I'm honest. And, you know, the~, there's a ultimate pace that you get to and that's it,
<Sync time="4289.53"/>
[noise] and I think it's showing we're the pros now that, #um, you know, new car, we, we, it's gotta be balanced and we'll, we'll see what happens with no, no real change, just try and stay on the track.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4300.544" endTime="4303.417">
<Sync time="4300.544"/>
[noise] That sounds like a sensible idea. Thank you, Andrew. Appreciate it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk11" startTime="4303.417" endTime="4306.499">
<Sync time="4303.417"/>
[noise] Cheers. [noise]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4306.499" endTime="4354.818">
<Sync time="4306.499"/>
[noise] Well, thank you very much, Andy. So well, there is the Beechdean car then. They're really down in tenth place in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three at the moment, so they don't score [breath] a point but, #uh, that's about it, unfortunately, and it's all about, #uh, [breath] recovering now in race two if it's all possible.
<Sync time="4320.134"/>
[noise] Joe back in here with some of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four battling, we now have that, #uh, pit stop penalty served by Scott Malvern. So, he has dropped down the order, [breath] out of the podium, but, in fact, there he is, we just got a glimpse of him in the red, #uh, black Mercedes.
<Sync time="4332.153"/>
[noise] [breath] Just ahead of his group [lipsmack] that's the, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; KTM &lt;/initial&gt; Crossbow (()) the #uh, [breath] #uh, discarded rubber, [breath] #uh, cor~, corner which is a tire punishing corner at the best of times.
<Sync time="4343.764"/>
[noise] That's Scott Malvern back out so what positions (()), he's fifth of the [breath] pro-am cars at &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, but he is, #uh, about eleven far right, I'll reckon in the class.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4354.818" endTime="4383.687">
<Sync time="4354.818"/>
[noise] #uh, Just looking at him, #uh, we're looking the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four cars on track here, top way overall, five gaps to the top (()) under a second. #uh, It is really really close for very significant positions. It's four of them,
<Sync time="4368.829"/>
[noise] #uh, astounding stop for these guys. It's great to see, sure enough from, #uh, Andrew Howard's perspective, great to see the difference in the way that they produce remarkably similar lap times. It's just two and a half minutes left and the sixty minutes float by.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4383.687" endTime="4465.576">
<Sync time="4383.687"/>
[noise] Yeah, it's been all action, hasn't it? The good news is we get to do this all over again this afternoon in race two. [breath] Race one not finished with yet though. And nor Jonny Adam, he's got, he would hope, [breath] a few extra tools in his toolbox that he can throw [breath] at Ryan Radcliff in the Bentley.
<Sync time="4397.413"/>
[noise] The race leader, Phil Keen, is going past some of the top ten winners in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, final time. [breath] And then he'll have to put a lap on that, this will be the penultimate lap of the race, I reckon though. [breath] So, he no doubt will have a bit more traffic to deal with before the checking flag flies. [breath] There is the number Fifty-eight McLaren,
<Sync time="4412.182"/>
[noise] that is running in, [breath] #uh, one, two, three, four, five, sixth position outright in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four. So he's some of the, #uh, strugglers in the, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four category coming through. [breath] Before much longer we'll see that green Lamborgini,
<Sync time="4425.35"/>
[noise] there it is, he'll be [breath] emerging into our sight. The race leader, Al Wright, he's looking like fairly cooked (()) in the head. The question is, he'll be joining on the podium, we've had a change there that's (()) will be inside [breath] of Jonny Adam. Jonny will try to fight back. There goes the Bentley straight,
<Sync time="4439.593"/>
[noise] [breath] but he surely won't have the ((polies)) in a straight line. But he's keeping up, but he's actually pulling back alongside here. [breath] Wheel to wheel for third position there, Jonny Adam has the outside line (()), that will be the inside line (()), Seb Morris says not on your life,
<Sync time="4452.929"/>
[noise] [breath] and almost has a go at [laugh] getting past the, #uh, (()) Parker example in front. [breath] But we didn't see how that started, but we saw the sense, didn't we Joe, that it would require [breath] of a stake or a hold up of some sort for any of the positions to change [breath] and that seems to be what's happened.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4465.576" endTime="4514.839">
<Sync time="4465.576"/>
[noise] Yeah, a little like ((the previous one)) had truly done so. I don't know if (()) all these or a, a problem for our on to the back ((straight)), but I'm just surprised how good the Aston was in a straight line there so, he, #uh, or did they manage to, here we go. So, Ratcliff has got the brakes a little early.
<Sync time="4479.987"/>
[noise] And Jonny's had nowhere to go. I don't think that Jonny wants to be on the outside, but it's either that [overlap] or, or hit Radcliff, but Ryan Scott he's always ((out)), but for me it's fair enough he's just enough in front to dictate where he can put the car, and Jonny has to, unfortunately, go on the grass.
<Sync time="4494.008"/>
[noise] But I, I don't think Jonny looked to the outside, I think Ryan broke a bit earlier than, than expected and it was either outside or in his, #uh, in his rear bumper, so that was unfortunate for Jonny to give Seb one lap to give it a go,
<Sync time="4505.21"/>
[noise] both the same cars (()) race car and a bit of white and silver-silver ((pedal seat)). #uh, So I'd say, oh, (()) from over there just gonna give Jonny a chance now. ((Things are happening)).
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4514.839" endTime="4544.658">
<Sync time="4514.839"/>
[noise] Well, this is fascinating, he's still (()) to Seb Morris there for [breath] being, #uh, having the, the self-awareness there to sort of go for that gap as soon as it presented itself. [breath] We are though, on the final lap of the race. Unfortunately, it's one of those races you don't really want to end.
<Sync time="4529.346"/>
[noise] [breath] Phil Keen would be quite grateful to see the checkered flag, but so too I think with [laugh] Seb Morris. He's now under pressure again from Jonny Adam.
<Sync time="4534.98"/>
[noise] [overlap] His car coming to the turn then Jonny Adam gets sideways [overlap] (()) Jonny Cocker. [breath] Around the outside, he just got through, fantastic, (()) Jonny Cocker takes full advantage.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4544.658" endTime="4575.814">
<Sync time="4544.658"/>
[noise] I think Jonny's gonna get the position back from Cocker. That was a big old snap from Jonny there around, #uh, (()), Jonny was particularly fair on Horace. I think if I was, #uh, Jonny I think I would've had Seb on the grass, and then (()) [laugh] but he, #uh, he gave them plenty of racing room.
<Sync time="4558.563"/>
[noise] Looks like Cocker's got (()) streak and Jonny just about got on the brake, so I think that's probably it for these positions unless there's a mistake. I think the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Fours are all we've seen,
<Sync time="4568.723"/>
[noise] #uh, Collard, #uh, go past Broadhurst with third overall as well, so that's good for Jon and that's a good step from him.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4575.814" endTime="4614.387">
<Sync time="4575.814"/>
[noise] Phil Keen then out of the final corner. He's going to take his first victory of the season. They've had a second, a fourth and now, a win, here at Snetterton (()) Barwell powered by Motorsport were two of the first three races of season.
<Sync time="4590.026"/>
[noise] It's big damage on the front now though, and the (()) Bentley and Seb Morris is gonna lose two places on the ((road)) to the line. [overlap] What has happened at the final corner there? There must have been contact somewhere. Cockerer That means that Ratcliff is second, Adam is third
<Sync time="4602.745"/>
[noise] and Jonny Cocker [applause] fourth and ((Burwell)) are elated with that. Jonny Cocker [laugh] getting an extra position at the flag, [breath] and Seb Morris drops off the podium. You made the point there ((that wherever)) you could see where he was going.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4614.387" endTime="4622.073">
<Sync time="4614.387"/>
[noise] (()) you said about (()) dropping out. [laugh] [overlap] That's, #uh, I bet you guys (()) sports first experience of the commentator's guess. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4622.073" endTime="4627.954">
<Sync time="4622.073"/>
[noise] [laugh] I wonder where the contact come from. I'd be interested to see the, #uh, the back of Ratcliff's car, that'll be the logical explanation.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4627.954" endTime="4652.063">
<Sync time="4627.954"/>
[noise] Lead car by the way in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four managed (()) by Senan Fielding has come right down, #uh, to around five seconds when they cross the line. (()) last turn around but, #uh, think he's going to be able to control that for a startler,
<Sync time="4640.39"/>
[noise] #uh, return performance from (()), #uh, in the Audi &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, they damaged the front of that, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; JRN &lt;/initial&gt; Bentley with the twenty-ninth car, careless there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4652.063" endTime="4673.893">
<Sync time="4652.063"/>
[noise] Looks really well balanced between corner and corner, that really loads the car. It's got a little bit of body rolling, but he~, that helps slow the slide, you need the grip anyway, [breath] #uh, traction everytime I've seen it. It's not leaving a big set (()) I think so,
<Sync time="4663.857"/>
[noise] they've also got the traction, pretty much sorted flashing his headlights, and, #uh, (()) been a big win for that team. (()) for the past few years (()) racing against anyway.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4673.893" endTime="4720.818">
<Sync time="4673.893"/>
[noise] Yeah, they Audi R eight S &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four has had success across Europe with &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four racing, and now it wins [breath] in its first appearance in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt;. And second place will be, [breath] #uh, the number four Toleman McLaren. That's another solid result for them, [breath] #uh, which they, they really needed actually,
<Sync time="4688.182"/>
[noise] they were ((sick to the)) point that Toleman in the first place built a car. Another one here [breath] in race one, ((it's the Aston)), number fifty-eight battling away here that is, [breath] #uh, four per ounce seven ((through six an inch of)) &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, [breath] and the battles continue right to the line.
<Sync time="4702.215"/>
[noise] Phil Keen though [breath] managed to escape all of the drama, and what drama that was behind him, what goes on here then so, [breath] the B~, the Bentleys all that close together [overlap] coming out of the, #uh, right under Nelson,
<Sync time="4713.503"/>
[noise] but there is some traffic up the road, [breath] which delays Ryan Ratcliff. [breath] He has a big moment, and then Joe, [breath] it's on from there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4720.818" endTime="4744.181">
<Sync time="4720.818"/>
[noise] [overlap] All right, so, yeah, so the Aston &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, I think, probably does what it has to do. And get out of the front and leave a brake, so Ratcliff doesn't come across the front of it. [breath] And Morris I would say has probably gambled on that not happening
<Sync time="4732.912"/>
[noise] and hoping the Aston actually goes down the inside, and he can follow the momentum and [breath] I think it was just concertinaed up very quickly, the Aston was probably going twenty, [music] thirty K slower than it would on a normal lap (()).
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="4744.181" endTime="4750.393">
<Sync time="4744.181"/>
[music] Well, effectively, he played the same gamble that got him the place against Jonny Adam earlier, it didn't pay off this time.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4750.393" endTime="4837.687">
<Sync time="4750.393"/>
[music] Mm, no, exactly and it's (()) the split-second decisions to that can make all the difference, aren't they? [breath] So, Adam Balon and Phil Keen are your third [breath] different race winners in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three from the first three races of the season. Glynn Geddie and Ryan Radcliff are second,
<Sync time="4763.304"/>
[music] [breath] Graham Davidson and Jonny Adam salvage a podium place [breath] after what was a frantic race for them as well. Sam De Haan and Jonny Cocker fourth (()) [breath] and Seb Morris did limp across the line with Dan in fifth place. They lost their second podium finish of the season.
<Sync time="4777.203"/>
[music] Mike Liger and Adam Willcox, full credit to them as well, they're debuting the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three category (()) Motorsports, [breath] and they are sixth place overall. (()) are number seven, &lt;initial&gt; TF &lt;/initial&gt; sports number two car is eighth, [breath] Century Motorsports racer promised much for the century &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Three cars,
<Sync time="4791.855"/>
[music] [breath] unfortunately, delivers relatively little. Senan Fielding, as we said a Richard Williams win [breath] in the, #uh, number twenty-nine &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four Audi. They win &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four, they're also a Pro-Am duo as well [breath]
<Sync time="4802.836"/>
[music] and that is the first Pro-Am car that has won outright [breath] in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four this season so far. Great result for them second place [breath] in the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four category goes to them before Tolman Motorsports, McLaren, [breath]
<Sync time="4815.342"/>
[music] and the number five example, #um, from Tolman, is third. So, Tolman have two cars on the podium [breath] in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four [breath] and breath everybody, that was a fantastic race.
<Sync time="4827.508"/>
[noise] Phil Keen looking remarkably calm, because he missed out on most of the drama there, didn't he? He managed to, #uh, escape the chaos behind [breath] and takes a fairly comfortable victory, Andy.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4837.687" endTime="4845.052">
<Sync time="4837.687"/>
[noise] Phil, I said to you beforehand, you've got the best record in British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; history at Snetterton and you were kind of a bit blasé about it proved it once again.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="4845.052" endTime="4857.736">
<Sync time="4845.052"/>
[noise] Well, I think, #uh, you know, the team and my teammates did a great job today and that's half the battle, isn't it? So you know Adam drove really well had a bit of a bad start, but made up for last time and [breath] you know, we had a good pit stop the guys. So, I have got a good car so, yeah, it makes my life easier.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4857.736" endTime="4863.058">
<Sync time="4857.736"/>
[noise] It was all kicking off behind you. How much were you aware of that and how much were you thinking, just stay in front and keep it clean?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="4863.058" endTime="4871.645">
<Sync time="4863.058"/>
[noise] Yeah, I mean that was all we did really just, #uh, you know drove around sensible pace and just look after the car for the next race and, #uh, you know, monitor the gap. So, you know, it was good.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4871.645" endTime="4876.434">

[noise] The Iceman reputation continues buddy congratulations [overlap] mate, well done, [overlap] happy days.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4876.434" endTime="4905.774">
<Sync time="4876.434"/>
[noise] Thanks, Andy. Well, Phil Keen, #uh, rarely is, #uh, an excitable chap. He's fairly, he's very quick driver, but very laid back indeed [breath] and, #uh, that was a brilliant performance. Barwell looking strong this year, aren't they, #um, [breath]
<Sync time="4889.824"/>
[noise] they had that victory for the, #uh, sixty-nine car at Oulton Park. This is the second visit to the podium now for seventy-two. [breath] The Lamborghini, to my own trained eye, [laugh] seems to be [breath] of the new generation cars, the most similar to its predecessor.
<Sync time="4902.132"/>
[noise] Do you think that's got anything to do with the, the way in which they really hit the ground running this season?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="4905.774" endTime="4935.558">
<Sync time="4905.774"/>
[noise] Yeah, a hundred percent. I think the clue is in the, the title of the car, so Lamborghini Huracán Evo. So, that's an evolution, whereas the other cars were revolution, brand new car for Bentley for Aston Martin, for Aston McLaren. So they've probably taken over seventy, eighty of what they knew
<Sync time="4920.643"/>
from the old car into this new one. So they're tweaking and fine-tuning, whereas the other guys are really struggling to maybe get on top of every aspect of the car and when the race this close, it only takes one setting to be [overlap] slightly off and, #uh, it looks like the Lambo's got the big advantage over everyone at the [breath] moment.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4935.558" endTime="4950.172">
<Sync time="4935.558"/>
[noise] Well speaking of big advantages at one point about thirteen seconds clear of the rest of the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four field was the Steller Motorsport, [breath] #uh, Audi R Eight &lt;initial&gt; LMS &lt;/initial&gt; &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four they take the victory [breath] in their first appearance in the championship.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4950.172" endTime="4954.401">

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk7" startTime="4954.401" endTime="4977.127">
<Sync time="4954.401"/>
[noise] Yeah, (()) to be fair all the hard work was done by Richard my, #uh, co-driver. He did an absolutely amazing first and so, #uh, big hats off to him, but no, #uh, just honestly the, the team deserved this win, #uh, they've been working hard, so hard like, #uh, days and, #uh,
<Sync time="4967.8"/>
[noise] to come here debut for the Audi, #uh, shows, it's a brilliant, #uh, car straight out of the box and get the first win, it's absolutely unbelievable. So, yeah, really over the moon with that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4977.127" endTime="4979.348">

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk7" startTime="4979.348" endTime="4989.485">
<Sync time="4979.348"/>
[noise] [overlap] Yeah, definitely it looks like I've got to do the hard stint in this next one and it's going to be difficult but the same again, we're just gonna go out there and enjoy it and aim for the best. You never know what's gonna happen in &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; racing.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="4989.485" endTime="4991.519">

<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="4992.404" endTime="5027.523">
<Sync time="4992.404"/>
[noise] That certainly was an unpredictable race one, race two, later on, [breath] not likely to be all that much different either. Another one hour encounter, the pro drivers will take the first stint on that occasion though, [breath] that one, incidentaly, will be, #uh, starting at about twenty-five minutes past three,
<Sync time="5006.501"/>
[noise] so make sure you're in position [breath] this afternoon for what is [laugh] set to be [breath] an enthralling fourth round of the championship. [breath] For now, though, drivers assembling a big crowd assembling down by the podium. There are lots of people here this weekend. Graham, it's great to see the support for this championship.
<Sync time="5020.726"/>
[noise] We keep [breath] raving to everybody and telling everyone how good it is. [breath] It's really nice to see so many spectators turning up and realizing the same thing.

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="5027.523" endTime="5071.483">
<Sync time="5027.523"/>
[noise] It's got a really loyal fan base, Snetterton always brings the crowds out. It's a great place to come and watch Motorsports, [breath] #uh, but British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; beginning to get the momentum and it's deserved for some years now and what will help that is that variety,
<Sync time="5040.705"/>
[noise] the kind of battling we saw all the way down through that top ten, #uh, but also, you know, (()) it was so nice to see a new winning team in Steller Motorsport there. They've had their travails. They're still working in the background,
<Sync time="5054.65"/>
[noise] [breath] with the car we've seen in previous seasons here, but to bring a new car here, literally out of the box, and then come and win in that way that was great stuff to see. This again, they're the tales that people like to come and see. It'll give them more backing, gives the championship a bit more depth.
<Sync time="5068.483"/>

[noise] Second place is not quite the win despite the fact that they lead at various points in the race. In the end, [breath] the victory goes the way of, #uh, Phil Keen, [breath] #uh, with the, the second stint in the, #uh, Lamborghini Huracán Adam Balon who started the car,
<Sync time="5111.524"/>
[noise] did a superb job as well. They overcame, [breath] #um, [lipsmack] #uh, a~, an awful lot of overtaking, they had to do, they were stuck in traffic quite some time as well. They, [breath] #uh, benefited I guess from the fact that they didn't have any, #uh, pit stop penalty to serve,
<Sync time="5124.101"/>
[noise] but nonetheless, they had to get the job done [breath] and Phil made that decisive move to take the race lead away just after the pit stops [breath] and escaped the battle behind and we saw [breath] that even people like Jonny Cocker, when they got embroiled in that battle they couldn't escape. [breath]
<Sync time="5137.977"/>
[noise] Phil Keen was able to do so though [lipsmack] and brought the car home for a fantastic victory.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="5143.172" endTime="5158.095">
<Sync time="5143.172"/>
[noise] Well, Jonny Cocker could have ended up anywhere on that podium [overlap] at some point with the exception, the win. But, #uh, that four-car battle in the last twenty minutes, #uh, real classic British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; action and, #uh, I think we've got more of the same to come later today with a second race here.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="5158.095" endTime="5179.232">
<Sync time="5158.095"/>
[noise] Yeah, I absolutely agree and one of the big fascinations is, [breath] #uh, the mix for two classes, the mix of different driver experiences out there, different cars that have different [breath] strengths and weaknesses as well out there and we saw all, saw all of that unfold in that race. [breath]
<Sync time="5171.626"/>
[noise] #uh, Joe, that is why this championship is so exciting to be involved with right now, isn't it? Each and every race that comes by [breath] is impossible to predict.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="5179.232" endTime="5211.539">
<Sync time="5179.232"/>
[noise] Yeah, a hundred percent and I think we saw a multi-class, #uh, getting involved there, the lapping of &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four cars adds a huge dynamic to this and, #uh, keeps it interesting for everyone and then you've got the classes within the class so the Pro-Am versus the silver-silvers,
<Sync time="5191.232"/>
[noise] which [breath] they're trying to be equal as, as much as they can with the weight or the pit stop penalty and it keeps it interesting. Ho~, honestly, I was amazed. I'll put that out just was the first time for me, #uh, watching it from this view in the car actually,
<Sync time="5202.559"/>
[noise] #uh, is a bit easier to follow, [laugh] #uh, sometimes, #uh, yeah, absolutely amazing racing and I, I hope, #uh, it's been a good advert for British &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; and &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; racing as a whole really.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="5211.539" endTime="5264.076">
<Sync time="5211.539"/>
[noise] I've been saying for years you racing drivers have it easy, you only have to focus on one car. You know, that's the only thing you need to worry about. We've got thirty-six of the things to keep track of, [breath] #uh, but it's an awful lot of fun and great to have you here as well. We're looking forward to having you back again for, #uh, [breath] race two later on.
<Sync time="5223.593"/>
[noise] &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four podium presentation now being made as well [breath] and what a stellar performance it was for the Audi R Eight &lt;initial&gt; LMS &lt;/initial&gt; &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four car. We know that it had the potential, it's run well, [breath] #uh, in things like the European &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four championship for example
<Sync time="5238.172"/>
[noise] [breath] and, #um, it's great to have it here in the &lt;initial&gt; UK &lt;/initial&gt; championship and great to see they're straight on the pace [breath] and I don't think that'll be the last appearance that we see of that car on the podium. [breath] McLarens, left, right and center, they're really at the front of, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four.
<Sync time="5251.941"/>
[noise] It was interesting to me actually the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four battles today. [breath] We saw at Oulton Park it was sort of McLaren versus Ford, wasn't it, for the battling at the fronts. [breath] This weekend alone Fords were decent in qualifying, Graham. In, in the race, they sort of faded, didn't they?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="5264.076" endTime="5300.783">
<Sync time="5264.076"/>
[noise] They did, did rather, unfortunately, the number nineteen car that problem, #uh, pretty early on with the, #uh, the puncture that just counted them out. Scott Maxwell was there in the mix, but then they take that pit stop penalty, [breath] and they just weren't close enough,
<Sync time="5277.768"/>
[noise] #uh, to make that pay, but, #uh, good to see a different looking pen~, #uh, a different looking podium [breath] and great to see, well, a couple of new faces at this stage and Richard Williams can be described as lots of things,
<Sync time="5289.859"/>
[noise] but a new face certainly is [laugh] one of them, #uh, but good to see, #uh, Richard Williams and Sennan Fielding. Joyful on the top step there, and he'll, they'll pop back to the team who will be absolutely overjoyed with that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="5300.783" endTime="5321.181">
<Sync time="5300.783"/>
[noise] And it's the first Pro-Am win for, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four team this year as well both the races [breath] at Oulton Park were won by silver driver combos and, #uh, [breath] goes to show that they've got the, the, we talked about ba~, balancing performance between the cars a lot,
<Sync time="5312.23"/>
[noise] but this balancing that goes on between the silver cars [breath] and the Pro-Am contenders. [breath] It works. doesn't it. Joe? Because the Pro-Am team still has a good shot at winning races.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="5321.181" endTime="5343.893">
<Sync time="5321.181"/>
[noise] Yeah, definitely. I think it's a great incentive for (()), in that car. (()) Williams has done such a good job as Sennan alluded to that has given him an opportunity to win overall with the pace he had in that car was probably closer to a, a silver
<Sync time="5333.316"/>
[noise] than it was to the other Ams [overlap] and he's been able to get that Pro-Am car to win overall on the, on the back of it and obviously they, #uh, get twice as many trophies [laugh] as well in Pro-Am so, #uh, yeah. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="5343.893" endTime="5348.216">
<Sync time="5343.893"/>
[noise] [laugh] They've been here before and they'd like to be there again, I think as well, [breath] [overlap] #uh, at some point.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="5348.216" endTime="5363.871">
<Sync time="5348.216"/>
[noise] It should be said, by the way, nicely orange. [overlap] For the rest yellow and green, [breath] but no, it's, #uh, it's lovely (()), this stage of,
<Sync time="5356.025"/>
[noise] the early stage of the championship, we're developing all sorts of [overlap] storylines here that will carry through what next, #uh.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="5363.871" endTime="5407.596">
<Sync time="5363.871"/>
[noise] Yeah, three different manufacturers as well, [breath] #uh, on the, #uh, podium in Pro-Am. Jonathan Wells, by the way, is the man who's making the, [breath] #uh, presentations. He's the &lt;initial&gt; UK &lt;/initial&gt; Motorsport manager of Pirelli [breath] and he has been, #uh, handing out the trophies
<Sync time="5378.792"/>
[noise] and now stands well back I'm sure, [laugh] because, [breath] #uh, for the third time on this (()) podium (()), the champagne [breath] sprays and, #uh, [laugh] the (()), the crowd enjoying it and the drivers enjoying it as well. [breath]
<Sync time="5391.934"/>
[noise] It's such a nice feeling, isn't it, and after, #uh, an hour [breath] of stress and pressure and worry, and, [breath] #uh, it's just so nice isn't it, Joe, if you aren't lucky enough to be on that podium.
<Sync time="5402.324"/>
[noise] [breath] Release some of that energy, release some of that tension and, and share the feeling with the crowd around you.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="5407.596" endTime="5416.768">
<Sync time="5407.596"/>
[noise] Yeah, definitely. Depends on who you're sharing the podium with and [laugh] if you like them or not is one thing, [music] but I was surprised how much budget these guys have got. All spraying, #uh, champagne. They've all got two spare [laugh] sets of suits.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk1" startTime="5416.768" endTime="5483.099">
<Sync time="5416.768"/>
[music] [laugh] Well, it was a full action hour of racing with contact beginning [breath] before we even reached turn number one. [breath] Plenty of contact out on the head. Then Lamborghini is on the receiving end of an awful lot of it. Sam de Haan got tipped into a slide [breath] and then, the pit stops began.
<Sync time="5431.136"/>
[music] And that was really when we started to see the race dynamic shuffling with [breath] those that were serving pitstop penalties [breath] slipping a bit further down the order. And it was for while, at least, the number seven Bentley of Ryan Ratcliffe that came out [breath] toward the sharp end of the field.
<Sync time="5445.024"/>
[music] Having led early on, they dropped ground then immediately started to regain it after number nine Century Motorsport car mysteriously slowed with an issue coming out of the first corner. [breath]
<Sync time="5454.65"/>
[music] There was drama, unfortunately, for the Balfe Motorsport McLaren, very close to a dream podium on their debut in the class [breath] before they had contact with the &lt;initial&gt; GT &lt;/initial&gt; Four car and spun off the road. [breath] For the much of the final portion of the race, it was all about the fight for the bottom steps of the podium
<Sync time="5469.297"/>
with Bentleys, Lamborghinis, and Aston Martins trading places [breath] and trading paint on a few occasions as well. [breath] Phil Keane and Adam Balon took their first victory of the season and they'll be looking to try and do the same in race two [breath] later on this afternoon.
