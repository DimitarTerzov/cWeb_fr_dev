This is a very uncomfortable topic. For most African-Americans and whites, we don't know how to talk to each other about it.
<Sync time="21.684"/>
And essentially we've been talking past each other, which is what people are exhausted about.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="25.292" endTime="92.83">
<Sync time="25.292"/>
Hey, y'all. I'm Tommy Tomlinson. I'm from &lt;initial&gt; WFAE &lt;/initial&gt; in Charlotte, this is SouthBound.
<Sync time="32.472"/>
[music] Mitch Landrieu comes from one of the south's most storied political families. His dad Moon Landrieu
<Sync time="38.942"/>
was mayor of New Orleans in the seventies. His sister Mary was a &lt;initial&gt; US &lt;/initial&gt; senator. Mitch was Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana,
<Sync time="47.661"/>
and then he served as mayor of New Orleans from twenty ten to twenty eighteen. After leaving office, he founded the &lt;initial&gt; E &lt;/initial&gt; Pluribus Unum initiative
<Sync time="57.363"/>
to study issues involving race in the south. He spent the past year interviewing people all over the region, as part of conversations in twenty eight communities
<Sync time="67.674"/>
involving issues such as segregation, equity, and violence. The report that came out of that work is called, Divided by Design.
<Sync time="76.187"/>
I talked with Landrieu about the report, and also about President Trump's recent comments, comparing the impeachment process against him to a lynching.
<Sync time="86.193"/>
Here's my conversation with Mitch Landrieu. What led you to form this organization?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="92.83" endTime="184.761">
<Sync time="92.83"/>
Well, you know, I, I, #uh besides just being a, a, a proud southerner, I was born in New Orleans in nineteen sixty,
<Sync time="103.017"/>
#uh for, into a really big family. I have eight brothers and sisters and collectively we now have thirty eight nieces and nephews.
<Sync time="109.966"/>
I'm a father of five children married and lawyer, but I served in the legislature for sixteen years. Lieutenant Governor of the state of Louisiana,
<Sync time="118.325"/>
#uh was elected to two terms in this state. Served there for six years, and then, of course, I came back home to New Orleans to help rebuild the city.
<Sync time="126.297"/>
And that experience, both in my personal life and my public life, #uh caused me to really think about the role that race has played or our inability to get past race,
<Sync time="140.887"/>
and how far behind the South is from where in my opinion she could be, and where the country could be, quite frankly,
<Sync time="148.052"/>
if we ever really understood our history, and we stopped letting people divide us, #uh by race and class. And I've just
<Sync time="155.898"/>
always thought in my life when I've tried to solve problems, that we have much more in common than apart. However,
<Sync time="161.651"/>
during that entire time that I was working, race always and class always became #um a, a, a place for division.
<Sync time="169.947"/>
And of course, we've seen throughout our history, throughout the world, that human beings can do awful things to each other when they start treating them less.
<Sync time="178.629"/>
And it's been part of our nation's ethos that, you know, all men are created equal. We've never really quite lived up to that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="184.761" endTime="200.863">
<Sync time="184.761"/>
So, you went to twenty eight communities throughout the south cities, smaller places, #um all rural and urban.
<Sync time="192.57"/>
#um Could you explain a little bit about what it was like when y'all got there? Like, what, what would you do when you got to a place?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="200.863" endTime="414.707">
<Sync time="200.863"/>
Well, let me, first of all, lem~ I, I will answer that question.
<Sync time="203.769"/>
But let me, let me just tell you why we, we spent time very, very low key talking to people. You know, when you, when you think that there's a problem,
<Sync time="214.207"/>
#um everybody has antidote eleven it's about that. They have their own opinions about it, they have their own experiences about it.
<Sync time="220.933"/>
When you're the mayor of the city of New Orleans and the catastrophes happening every day, you know, you don't really have time to think,
<Sync time="227.44"/>
and you draw conclusions about things. I wanted to take time. Just really slow down. Instead of listening to what we hear coming off of &lt;initial&gt; CNN &lt;/initial&gt;,
<Sync time="236.341"/>
&lt;initial&gt; MSNBC &lt;/initial&gt;, or FOX and listening to political people try to interpret for American citizens what they think, why don't we go talk to them ourselves?
<Sync time="244.956"/>
Why don't we listen to them? Why don't we hear them? Why don't we try to hear it through #uh through the lens that they intend to communicate it so that we can then come up
<Sync time="252.871"/>
with, #uh clearly communicating to the country what everybody's really thinking because my supposition was there's gonna be a lot of common ground.
<Sync time="260.898"/>
But also I expected to find a lot of divisions. So, what we did was we decided, #uh to start in the south. And that is where
<Sync time="269.359"/>
obviously where we're from. I think the South has a special obligation because of our history related to slavery, to address this issue,
<Sync time="277.152"/>
and to really kind of find people where they are. So, we weren't going to political rallies, or if we would have called on the mayor, as a matter of respect
<Sync time="285.590"/>
because we were in their town, it wasn't designed to be a mayor's meeting of what you would typically call community leaders that normally happen
<Sync time="292.702"/>
in city councils. We wanted to actually go into communities and talk to individuals. We talked to white people, and African American people,
<Sync time="300.68"/>
and the rich people, and poor people, we talked to Hispanic people, and Vietnamese people, whoever was in the communities, in the cities that we went to
<Sync time="307.738"/>
who were really just regular folk. #uh That's one thing that we did. The second thing that we did to make sure that we weren't just hearing antidote eleven
<Sync time="316.457"/>
is this, we actually did focus groups. And so we had firms that are that are experts at this that called,
<Sync time="323.243"/>
again, regular folks, you know, into a room. And they would sit in the room six at a time, eight at a time, ten at a time, depending on what the sample was. And
<Sync time="332.943"/>
sometimes they were folks that had college degrees or master's degree, sometimes they were folks that had high school degrees, sometimes it was folks that didn't.
<Sync time="340.775"/>
#um And sometimes the groups were mixed, sometimes they were just white, sometimes they were uh, men, sometimes they were women. We just tried to get every different kind of mix,
<Sync time="349.744"/>
so that we could make sure that we really heard everything that everybody wanted to say in all kinds of different settings. And then we would actually have, #um
<Sync time="357.687"/>
invite the community to come to meetings. And then we would have community discussions. Those things. And it cha~ it changed in every community that we went to depending on where
<Sync time="366.753"/>
we were, and whether people were willing to talk to us or not. But we really feel like we heard what it is that people had on their minds and on their hearts.
<Sync time="375.633"/>
And we were in places where people felt comfortable to speak the truth as they thought it was. Now that we think we know what it is that they've said
<Sync time="385.114"/>
because they've clearly communicated that to us, let's see if we can take all of the data, all of the research that we've done,
<Sync time="392.137"/>
and draw some conclusions from that, which we did. And we drew fifteen conclusions. And then after that, we said, well, if those are the conclusions,
<Sync time="400.236"/>
how do you, how do you go about creating an environment where these individuals can talk to each other, know each other and see if they
<Sync time="409.036"/>
can begin to solve the problems that it's colu~ that those conclusions make, make really, really clear?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="414.707" endTime="453.566">
<Sync time="414.707"/>
I, I wonder what the emotional tenor of those all these conversations that you had over time. Obviously, it's a bunch of different people and this can be
<Sync time="423.637"/>
a wide range, but I know just from living in the south my whole life, that when this stuff tends to come up, whether it's
<Sync time="431.462"/>
white folks or black folks or whatever, there's like a, almost a baked in sort of weariness about it. Like, yes, this is a terrible thing, or maybe
<Sync time="440.384"/>
some people feel like it's not a terrible thing or whatever. But there it feels like it's, it's a conversation we've had for a long, long time.
<Sync time="446.945"/>
I'm wondering what the sort of the emotional tenor of the conversations that y'all had was like.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="453.566" endTime="526.594">
<Sync time="453.566"/>
Well, interesting. #uh #uh I would, I would respond to that in two ways. First of all, the, all of the conversations were calm and respectful.
<Sync time="461.075"/>
Every one of them. We never had a shouting match with anybody. We wanted to make sure that we listened and that we heard, and they knew that we heard what it is that they said.
<Sync time="470.033"/>
We didn't have debating classes, you know, in our debating forums at, at, at this point. And, and we learned a couple of different things.
<Sync time="478.61"/>
Number one, and this is universally true. That this is a very uncomfortable topic for most African-Americans and whites. We don't know how to talk to each other about it.
<Sync time="487.974"/>
And essentially, we've been talking past each other, which is what people are exhausted about. Talking past each other and not getting anywhere.
<Sync time="494.41"/>
There's, it's clear that people are tired of that. And so what &lt;initial&gt; E &lt;/initial&gt; Pluribus Unum wants to do, is try to find a pathway where we can actually go through this.
<Sync time="500.871"/>
Not around it, not over it, not under it, but through it. Now, once you get past that truth, then the polling data in all of
<Sync time="510.114"/>
the interviews that we did, #uh [lipsmack] evidence of very, very, very wide divide. African-Americans don't think we talk about it enough.
<Sync time="518.938"/>
White people think we talk about it too much. Hispanic people think half and half, depending on what [laugh] communities
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="526.594" endTime="526.882">
<Sync time="526.594"/>
Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="526.882" endTime="708.081">
<Sync time="526.882"/>
that they're in, which itself is a very interesting finding. Because yeah, some people are like, whatever.
<Sync time="531.02"/>
#um No, it wasn't a problem. Slavery was a long time ago. Now if you ask people and the, the poll reflects this, that white people, particularly, hey white person,
<Sync time="539.98"/>
do you think that the vestiges of slavery exists today? Most of them do not. They don't think that there's any consequences (()) from slavery today.
<Sync time="550.03"/>
It was such a long time ago, nobody knows anybody. #uh African-Americans, clearly don't think about that. Now, if you ask people, well, do you think that slavery,
<Sync time="559.328"/>
reconstruction, Jim Crow, civil rights, and the things that have happened have an impact today? More white people will say, yeah,
<Sync time="567.341"/>
I, I, I can see that and I can feel that which is, means that there's a movement. But listen, I, Let me just mention this story. I was talking to my dad
<Sync time="574.41"/>
today who, as you know, served as mayor of New Orleans before I did, from nineteen seventy to nineteen seventy eight. Nineteen sixty, he was one of only two
<Sync time="581.981"/>
white legislators that voted against segregation. And he lived through a lot of what's going on now. He said to me today when I s~ told him
<Sync time="590.87"/>
what I just told you about white people thinking that slavery is so (()), he said, son let me tell you something, he said, I'm eighty nine years old.
<Sync time="596.179"/>
I was born in nineteen thirty. He said I knew, spent time with and hugged my great grandmother. She was born in eighteen forty nine.
<Sync time="606.046"/>
He goes, I physically touched this woman. She was sixteen year old, sixteen years old when Lincoln died, which meant that she lived during the time of slavery
<Sync time="614.963"/>
and lived through the Civil War. And he said, so it wasn't really that long ago. And it's not that far back when you begin to think about
<Sync time="622.207"/>
generational consequences from acts of slavery. Now, I don't I, #uh #uh I personally don't think it's very arguable
<Sync time="630.368"/>
that institutions that we have, the way we build highways, the way we build neighborhoods, how we constructed our school districts,
<Sync time="638.586"/>
what gerrymandering looks like, our voting, you know, rights, laws. I don't think there's much doubt that there is institutional bias, that has made it much much harder
<Sync time="649.421"/>
for African-Americans in the south #um [lipsmack] to do well. And that is really kind of what is defined as institutional racism. Many
<Sync time="658.73"/>
whites feel from our discussion that racism to them means them being angry or mean, or hurling a epithet personally at another human being.
<Sync time="669.224"/>
#uh And that's, that's partly true, you know, and anytime you treat another human being as less than you, for whatever reasons, if it's about race
<Sync time="677.152"/>
is an act of racism. But it's much, much deeper than that. It's the, and African-Americans tend to think that although that's horrible, and they don't want to be the victims of that
<Sync time="685.969"/>
today, that institutional bias and institutional racism and things that have stopped them from building generational wealth, like not being able to get mortgages and not being able to
<Sync time="694.731"/>
build homes in certain areas, and consequently pass it down to their children, has made it harder for their kids and it has for other kids. And there's a lot of truth
<Sync time="702.709"/>
in a lot of these things. And the question gets to be for the South, you know, can we talk about it?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="708.081" endTime="730.129">
<Sync time="708.081"/>
You talked about, you know, a minute ago, the sort of institutional racism and the, and the divide over whether that's
<Sync time="715.667"/>
real or not, and how people feel and how it lands on people and all. And this report that you guys came up with is called, Divided by Design.
<Sync time="722.96"/>
Is that the design you're talking about? Like when you say, des~ design is, is that what you mean?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="730.129" endTime="1038.753">
<Sync time="730.129"/>
Yeah, that's exactly what I mean. I think one of the, you know, it's one of these things, #uh is about the language we use. So, for example,
<Sync time="736.927"/>
if you start talking about white privilege reparations, you know, everybody's eyes start to roll, people start to cough, they walk away, mostly white people [laugh],
<Sync time="744.195"/>
you know. But if you start talking about, you know, values, like, you know, do you think that if you broke something, you should fix it?
<Sync time="751.096"/>
Or do you think that if something was not designed properly and it hurts somebody, that you should redesign it? They go, well, yeah, I can.
<Sync time="758.459"/>
Yeah, I mean, of course, that's true. But then you have to make the next step and say, well, listen, let me show you how things were designed. So, for example,
<Sync time="766.537"/>
I'll give you an intentional bad design. #uh And this is just as late as the sixties. This isn't eight you know, nineteen thirty or nineteen ten,
<Sync time="775.632"/>
but when they began to rebuild neighborhoods in the great urban revival that we had through the fifties sixties and seventies, especially when
<Sync time="784.013"/>
everybody who fought in the war was coming back. African-Americans and whites not everybody got the &lt;initial&gt; GI &lt;/initial&gt; Bill.
<Sync time="790.11"/>
&lt;initial&gt; GI &lt;/initial&gt; Bill gave money to returning soldiers to go build houses in certain places. #uh There were, they wouldn't when neighborhoods were being rebuilt,
<Sync time="799.822"/>
banks would draw red lines around certain neighborhoods and they would not give mortgages to African-Americans. Now, anybody that sort of grew up in a house
<Sync time="808.825"/>
that you owned, you know, that that house, mostly, you know, gets more valuable, and the kind of equity that financial equity, you know, that you talked to that there
<Sync time="820.439"/>
is some kind of institutional wealth that is generated from that that is actually passed down. #um If you're able to afford insurance, if you're able to get a good job,
<Sync time="828.607"/>
all of those things did not really exist for members of the African American community, all of them. And because there was discrimination, that is an intentional design
<Sync time="837.793"/>
and it stopped people from getting ahead. So, you know, if you lose ten twenty thirty years of building wealth, and you can't pass that down to your kids and the kids
<Sync time="846.535"/>
don't have the opportunity then, to start there and then lift the generation because of course, everybody hundred percent of people want their kids to do better than they did.
<Sync time="853.785"/>
Hundred percent. And matter of fact, that's what everybody wants, they want a good job. And they want to be able to give their kids more. If you weren't able to do that
<Sync time="861.096"/>
because you couldn't move in a certain neighborhood, or because they stopped the street from going through, or because they wouldn't let a bus line go into another neighborhood,
<Sync time="868.616"/>
because they didn't want African-Americans coming into the neighborhood, or because they gerrymandered legislative districts to make sure that they packed African-Americans in the
<Sync time="875.155"/>
district. So, they couldn't have more votes than not. All of those things are things that were designed by intention, human being hate to change.
<Sync time="882.582"/>
I mean, whatever, [laugh] whatever it is that we have. We are anathema to change just because we get used to it. And some people that are actually being hurt by things
<Sync time="891.604"/>
don't like changing the things. And as a matter of fact, change really freaks people out when it comes too fast. So, you bump it up against that as well. So,
<Sync time="899.011"/>
if somebody comes into down, you know, and you've been, you've been living a certain way. You go, man, look, I'm tired. I'm old. You know, I don't really feel like
<Sync time="908.057"/>
you know, doing it better and I'm just gonna leave alone. As matter of fact, I remember a conversation that I had with a gentleman I was in the Delta.
<Sync time="914.764"/>
I won't call the town but, #uh this particular gentleman was an older gentleman, he was African American. And, you know, like in every everybody knows that what I'm
<Sync time="923.179"/>
about to say is true. That if you go into a southern town, and white folks live in certain place and African American folks live in another place. There's a railroad track,
<Sync time="930.871"/>
there's a river, or there's a lake that or highway that separates you. You know, that's what we call well you know, back of town front of town, you know, over the over there.
<Sync time="944.101"/>
[overlap] Wrong side of the tracks. All of that stuff comes from that language. Now, if you are in the south, you know, you don't think about this because every day,
<Sync time="950.319"/>
it's just something that you naturally do and then you ask yourself, why do, why do all the [laugh] white people live over here, and why do all the African American people
<Sync time="957.423"/>
live over there? Well, it was designed that way. You know, are, there were things in place that forced it to move into that direction. But this gentleman that I was talking to,
<Sync time="965.901"/>
I asked him, I said, you know, because the town was divided by a lake, and the whole conversation that he was in with other people was, African-Americans live on this side of the lake
<Sync time="974.155"/>
and the white people live on this side other lake. I said, well, sir, do you have any racism here? He goes, oh, son, he goes, we good. He said, we have reached the place of peaceful
<Sync time="981.969"/>
segregation. And I never heard that before [laugh]. I said, I said, I don't understand what you just said to me. And he said, I don't know, your ears don't work?
<Sync time="992.711"/>
I said, no, no, I heard you. I said, I just don't understand you. He goes, we cool. We over here, they over there. Now, that takes my ears back to eighteen ninety.
<Sync time="1002.831"/>
You know, with separate but equal, but of course, it's never equal. Because you know, folks that have more change in their pocket, or do better than folks that don't have more change
<Sync time="1011.166"/>
in their pocket. And so what he di~ what he basically was saying is, look, this is as good as is gonna get for me. And I'm good to go and I don't really feel like
<Sync time="1018.77"/>
dealing with it. But that's not what young people think. When you look at this poll, people, young folks, #uh let me, #um say under thirty because I'm old man. I'm fifty nine.
<Sync time="1027.083"/>
But under thirty, I mean, a lot of young folks and folks that have higher levels of education, I want to say a college degree or higher, they really want to change it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1038.753" endTime="1050.913">
<Sync time="1038.753"/>
Were there, #um places on this tour that you felt like were having, #uh a tougher time maybe the most,
<Sync time="1045.743"/>
and were there, were there a place or two you felt like had sort of gotten a better handle on what to do?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1050.913" endTime="1141.596">
<Sync time="1050.913"/>
[noise] Actually, yeah. [lipsmack] #um There were, without calling the names out of the communities, they, they, #um what we did find that in Louisville, Kentucky,
<Sync time="1065.495"/>
#um and in New Orleans, #um because when I was mayor, we really talked a lot about an equity agenda, making sure that everybody was treated fairly,
<Sync time="1074.542"/>
gender, race, et cetera. And in Louisville, Kentucky, where Mayor Greg Fischer had a specific program that people were much more open to talking about it,
<Sync time="1084.452"/>
and that they had made some progress. As I said, without calling out the names of the communities, there are some communities throughout the south that have
<Sync time="1091.805"/>
gotten themselves into a position economically, where everybody is doing a little bit better. Then in, in other words, really, really, really #uh
<Sync time="1103.133"/>
po~ [lipsmack] difficult communities that are struggling financially, in communities where whites and African-Americans are struggling financially,
<Sync time="1111.858"/>
where the economy is leaving them behind. They all feel like they're getting left behind, but the racial tension is higher.
<Sync time="1118.441"/>
When everybody is got a little bit more money in their pocket, and more people are working and their wages are higher, and they're feeling a little bit more comfortable,
<Sync time="1126.725"/>
the racial tension is less, which I think is really interesting. You know, and and demonstrates to us that some of this is economic, it's just not personal.
<Sync time="1135.401"/>
It's just that sometimes people, people are ascribing to people of the other race, the reason why they're not doing well.

<Sync time="1209.511"/>
The divisions and the sort of anger, or whatever that people have thought of as being kind of a southern thing for a long, long time,
<Sync time="1219.876"/>
are now kind of writ large across the whole country. [laugh] And I'm, I'm wondering if what your thoughts are on the idea that, you know, are are,
<Sync time="1230.28"/>
are we becoming more like the rest of the country? Or is the rest of the country becoming more like us? [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1235.513" endTime="1499.339">
<Sync time="1235.513"/>
[laugh]. Oh, that's a great question. It's a loaded question too. Let me try to [overlap]
<Sync time="1240.699"/>
Yeah, no, no I hear you. Let me, let me try to answer it with a couple of different layers. First of all, #um I love the south. And I am a really
<Sync time="1249.292"/>
deeply proud American, have a great sense of faith, family and country. #um [lipsmack] And I have, I have great hopes and aspirations for America.
<Sync time="1259.696"/>
I, I happen to think though, even as a great patriot, that I have the right to call out our country when we're not living up to our ideals.
<Sync time="1268.479"/>
And if in fact the founding fathers said out of many we are one, that all men are created equal, that we're endowed with certain unalienable rights of life,
<Sync time="1276.13"/>
liberty and property that, you know, you know, they kind of meant it. Even though we have to acknowledge it, we've never actually really gotten there.
<Sync time="1283.055"/>
That's part &lt;initial&gt; A &lt;/initial&gt;. Part &lt;initial&gt; B &lt;/initial&gt;, as a, as a proud southerner who went to school in the northeast that constantly got beat on from being in the south,
<Sync time="1291.14"/>
you know, and I have a chip on my shoulder about how the rest of the country sees the south. I happen to think we're great I think, #uh I think
<Sync time="1298.95"/>
it's, its, the lifestyle's beautiful down here. I think the environment's beautiful. I think we have the kind of things that we have in here that you can't even come close
<Sync time="1307.067"/>
to in the north, the Northeast, the Midwest or the, or the, or the, the West and I'm just proprietary about that. And I have a jersey on but, but I do, but I do,
<Sync time="1316.234"/>
I do ache for m~ my south. Because as a result primarily of slavery, we sent four million people out of the South,
<Sync time="1327.752"/>
they they, they left. [breath] Because when they were here, we enslaved them. And so when th~ when they were freed,
<Sync time="1335.328"/>
they did what a very thoughtful, rational person would do and said, I'm getting the hell out of there. But we lost four million people, what we lost
<Sync time="1342.212"/>
was an incredible amount of intellectual talent, raw material, raw capital. Well, these individuals took their wares, and they went to other parts of the country, and spread
<Sync time="1352.426"/>
the value that they had here and we lost that. Whi~ white, white people lost that not just African-Americans lost an opportunity to live here. We lost
<Sync time="1360.238"/>
what value it is that they bring. All you've got to do now is just go back through history, and look at the incredible progress that African-Americans have made in sports
<Sync time="1368.723"/>
and medicine, in politics and say, you know, that many of those individuals used to live here and their families did and we lost that. And we sent some of our best players,
<Sync time="1377.848"/>
you know, to the other part of the country. What would it look like if all of those people, now the same thing happened when they left and the economy went down. And that white people,
<Sync time="1386.473"/>
 many of them poor, many of them not having a great education they didn't do particularly well, either. And so you have to think about that for a minute. When
<Sync time="1394.471"/>
the people from the north went, you know, if we put in our jerseys on, in the geographically in the country, how much better we could be
<Sync time="1400.691"/>
if we all really decided that we wanted to come together and work together. There are examples of when we have done that, and examples of when we have done well. That's why I think
<Sync time="1409.196"/>
the future of the south is really important. And I think that because we had a specific role that we played, we saw more people into slavery in New Orleans than any city in America.
<Sync time="1418.12"/>
That we have an obligation to stand up and be counted on this before we point a finger at the rest of the country. Now, having said that,
<Sync time="1425.914"/>
it is absolutely true. That when you get outside of the south, racism is alive and well. And class differences are alive and well. And
<Sync time="1436.375"/>
they, you know, I think it's always been there. It's been one of those things where we have won that burden more loudly than the rest of the country, but it is clearly an issue.
<Sync time="1445.265"/>
And today, even though we're talking about African-American and white, you know, we've had [breath] lots of examples, when other minorities have been hurt as well.
<Sync time="1453.788"/>
The Japanese internment comes to mind, immediately, #um Native Americans or American-Indians comes to mind. This whole notion of some people being superior to another
<Sync time="1464.296"/>
others manifests itself across racial differences, not just in America, but in any other country as well. And when that has happened, bad things have occurred.
<Sync time="1471.913"/>
And the country is never ever really going to do well unless we bring everybody along with us. And, and they welcome and they have an equal seat at the table of democracy. And
<Sync time="1482.362"/>
so, I do think it is a message for the rest of the country. I just think that we speak with much more moral authority,
<Sync time="1488.116"/>
when we acknowledge what it is that we've done and fix our problem first, before we try to get across the country. But I think our work will be very resonant
<Sync time="1496.169"/>
in other parts of American north, south, east and west.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1499.339" endTime="1534.544">
<Sync time="1499.339"/>
Now, I know that these divisions that you're talking about you confirm those directly in New Orleans when you were mayor, when you had the Confederate statues removed.
<Sync time="1508.469"/>
And I think a lot of people follow that story as it was happening and probably saw the speech you gave, that became kind of a viral, #uh thing across the country.
<Sync time="1518.751"/>
But I don't know whether many people know. So, what happened after that, you know, the statues came down. What happened then? So, what happened in New Orleans?
<Sync time="1527.334"/>
You know, over the last as I guess, they maybe two years, since the statues came down. [overlap] What what's going on there?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1534.544" endTime="1540.6">
<Sync time="1534.544"/>
Well, interesting. First of all, if you just take the statues down and you don't do anything else. I mean, those are just physical things.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1540.6" endTime="1540.922">
<Sync time="1540.6"/>
Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1540.922" endTime="1691.835">
<Sync time="1540.922"/>
Those statues, those statues represented a, a mindset of how people think, what's interesting about the process and, you know, I was
<Sync time="1549.013"/>
seemed to go on forever, but I, you know, I really wanted to go through it. I mean, I guess I could have just taken those monuments down,
<Sync time="1556.624"/>
like the day after I said I was gonna do it, but, and I think I would have been justified legally and doing it. But I wanted to go through a process
<Sync time="1563.766"/>
and I wanted to follow the law. So, we had lots of hearings. They were intense hearings. Now, one of the thing, reasons they were so intense, because a lot of people that
<Sync time="1571.988"/>
weren't from New Orleans, they weren't even from the State of Louisiana came here, as though they had some ownership
<Sync time="1578.63"/>
over those monuments. Now, you know, there are about three thousand of them. [overlap] [laugh] Around the south, and for people who don't know, they were put up well after the Civil War
<Sync time="1587.229"/>
ended. And they were put up by primarily, are in consultation with the daughters of the Confederacy, who wanted to, #uh perpetuate what they self-described as
<Sync time="1597.484"/>
the lost cause and how terrible it was that the cause of the south was lost, when the North or, or just the United States of America won the Civil War.
<Sync time="1606.266"/>
And they wanted to create a narrative of, you know, what our real history was when in fact, they were only talking about
<Sync time="1612.931"/>
a very narrow version of only four years of our history. And so, you know, in New Orleans, which prides itself on
<Sync time="1620.659"/>
having been one of the wealthiest cities in the country very early during that time, and always been a multicultural city,
<Sync time="1625.868"/>
always a mecca, always a port town. Those monuments didn't really reflect who we were. And we thought that i~ incidentally,
<Sync time="1632.694"/>
the picture that it created with the city was so narrow so it was to make it actually not the truth, or otherwise stated a lie.
<Sync time="1639.317"/>
So, when those monuments finally came down, you know, what has happened, interestingly enough, is that they they have, the spaces
<Sync time="1647.49"/>
have turned into places where people go to take their own pictures there, to get a sense of where they fit in this moment. Lee Circle,
<Sync time="1656.516"/>
quite frankly, old Lee Circle hasn't been replaced and stayed there just like it was. And so the pedal still standing, there's nothing on top of it.
<Sync time="1662.613"/>
And although I didn't plan that, and I didn't intend it, I wasn't able to do anything by the time I left, because time ran out.
<Sync time="1669.462"/>
It's actually not a bad thing for that to sit there empty, so people can contemplate what it's really supposed to mean.
<Sync time="1675.383"/>
And I'm hopeful that the city at some point in time, you know, will decide to make that space which is really the most prominent space in the city and
<Sync time="1682.313"/>
inviting space. That's a demand generated that speaks to what New Orleans really is to the rest of the world,
<Sync time="1688.299"/>
which is the soul of America. I mean, our diversity is our strength.

<Sync time="1691.835"/>
This podcast. We're not here for a few days. So, we're, we're talking in the middle of the week, and I think, you know, in the middle of next week, but
<Sync time="1698.944"/>
I feel like I have to ask you about something that was in the news today. And that was President Trump saying, that is the impeachment proceedings.
<Sync time="1708.243"/>
He compared them to being lynched. And then Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, #uh came behind him and said yes, in every way
<Sync time="1715.519"/>
that, #um it's like, what's happening to him it was like a lynching. And, #uh I wonder what your thoughts are on that?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1722.008" endTime="1951.695">
<Sync time="1722.008"/>
Well, I have a lot of thoughts about it. First of all, the President of the United States, i~ it is clear, worked with a foreign government
<Sync time="1730.536"/>
to investigate his political rivals. The Constitution forbids that in two different places. And as a consequence of that,
<Sync time="1741.621"/>
Congress now has the duty to investigate whether or not that activity rises to the level of an impeachable offense. Which is a very sobering,
<Sync time="1750.598"/>
painful thing, a process through which the country has only experienced in one form or another three separate times.
<Sync time="1757.948"/>
And that is very, very troubling. There is testimony being taken now from, #um folks that have been in the government that have served republican and Democrats,
<Sync time="1767.869"/>
the Inspector General that oka~ that, that basically said the whistle blower report was critical, was a republican that was appointed by President Trump.
<Sync time="1774.931"/>
This is a very serious nonpartisan matter, and the President unfortunately left Congress with no alternative but to do that duty,
<Sync time="1783.685"/>
and to investigate whether or not he actually has abused his power to the point of having been removed from office for the extraordinary,
<Sync time="1790.983"/>
#uh process of impeachment that was designed by the founding fathers. You know, when they design this, they knew that they were going to be elections.
<Sync time="1797.672"/>
They opine that from time to time we could have a chief executive officer that got to be Go~ a lot like King George, that needed to be removed before an election took place.
<Sync time="1808.623"/>
For the President of the United States who's white and who's a billionaire, to compare anything that he's going through to a lynching,
<Sync time="1816.303"/>
rises to such a height of ignorance and insensitivity that it's actually hard to respond to.
<Sync time="1822.819"/>
For, for the sake of people in the country who have not really thought about that, as Bryan Stevenson and Montgomery just opened up,
<Sync time="1830.821"/>
#uh a lynching Memorial that has listed by name, the three thousand eight hundred and, or so American citizens that were lynched in the south,
<Sync time="1841.814"/>
not in eighteen fifty, but between eighteen seventy and as far up as to the, you know, late decades of the twentieth century into the sixties.
<Sync time="1853.007"/>
Over thirty nine hundred African-Americans, in many instances for no reason at all, other than looking crooked at a white girl,
<Sync time="1861.416"/>
were ripped away from their homes, beaten, raped, sodomized, #uh their backs were torn apart by whips, and then they were hung in public squares.
<Sync time="1871.702"/>
Now, that's what lynching is. So, when when [breath] a white man who's a billionaire, who's the most powerful man in the world,
<Sync time="1880.05"/>
compares what's happening to him in a political setting. In many instances, what he brought upon himself through a legislative process designed by the founding fathers,
<Sync time="1892.376"/>
is ju~ just to me, it's it's really disgraceful, and it's disgusting. And I can imagine that President Trump is not happy
<Sync time="1902.787"/>
that he's in the position that he's in. But to suggest that it's like a lynching means that either he does not know the history of lynching,
<Sync time="1912.252"/>
or when it happened or why it happened, or he's so insensitive to it, that he would compare himself
<Sync time="1918.929"/>
to that. And I just think that, you know, he ought to do better. And Lindsey Graham, of all people, being a son of a south, you know, from a southern state that's got an incredible,
<Sync time="1929.203"/>
rich and wonderful history in some but a very, very dark history and other matters, especially on the issue of race and slavery,
<Sync time="1936.358"/>
ought to know better as well, that's sacred, that sacred ground and sacred language. And, you know, elected officials that represent the south ought to,
<Sync time="1943.654"/>
ought to, at least hold up the rest of the people in the country to speaking about this, in a way that gives re~ respect and understanding and clarity.

<Sync time="2001.762"/>
I know, #um #uh in two thousand and eighteen every time somebody asked you if you're going to run for president, before they could get the question out their mouth
<Sync time="2011.242"/>
you said no. #um I, I have two quick questions about that. One, considering where everything is right now, a little bit jumbled up in the, [noise]

<Sync time="2027.931"/>
[overlap] You got somebody there holding, #uh holding (()) up to your head. [overlap] [laugh] Why do you say you just wanted to ask me that question.

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2041.085" endTime="2116.174">
<Sync time="2041.085"/>
Let me, let me see if I can answer it forthrightly. Yes. The answer is no, #um I didn't, I did not feel
<Sync time="2046.965"/>
and I still don't feel like it was the right time or the right set of circumstances. The next question is, well, you know,
<Sync time="2054.331"/>
well, you said that, you're never going to do it. Well, in politics, you never say never, you know, there's, #uh I did this.
<Sync time="2058.7"/>
I have done this now for thirty years, I've been blessed. I love public service. I really have enjoyed it. But
<Sync time="2064.806"/>
being the mayor of City, New Orleans, during the time that I was there, we had to rebuild the city from the devastation of Katrina and Rita and Ike
<Sync time="2071.259"/>
and Gustav and the National recession, and the &lt;initial&gt; BPO &lt;/initial&gt;s [laugh] spill. You know, it was, it was a lot
<Sync time="2076.534"/>
and this just was not a great time #um for me. #uh The question is, do I have a regret,

you know, every, you know, when you kind of a, if you, if you're a horse and you run the track,

</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="2158.858" endTime="2340.201">
<Sync time="2158.858"/>
Well, I think the first thing I would ask them would be, do they believe that the founding fathers had it right,
<Sync time="2166.762"/>
when they said all men were created equal, #uh or that they had it right, as an aspiration that out of many we are one?
<Sync time="2174.591"/>
I think that's the first thing I would ask them. And if they will committed to that proposition.
<Sync time="2179.627"/>
Then I would ask them to think of themselves as the founding fathers and recognize looking back,
<Sync time="2185.411"/>
you know, from where we are two hundred or so years, whether or not that we've actually lived up to it to acknowledge,
<Sync time="2191.321"/>
for example, where we have fallen short, and to ask themselves to commit themselves to finding common ground that works for everybody.
<Sync time="2199.032"/>
If, in fact, the people of today said they really do all want to get together, they all think everybody j~ enjoys,
<Sync time="2204.613"/>
should have equal opportunity, and we want to leave our children better? #uh I actually did this when I was mayor of the city in Orleans. We had to
<Sync time="2210.947"/>
rebuild the city. We didn't build it back the way it was. I mean, that's the great tendency is that when building gets knocked down, just put it back up the next day [breath]
<Sync time="2217.105"/>
like a school. But what if the school wasn't great, you know, the day before it didn't, th~ the day before it got knocked down and you want it to build a new one,
<Sync time="2225.498"/>
would you build it the way you always wanted it to be? That's, that's really would be kind of the idea of the exercise. And I actually think
<Sync time="2233.041"/>
[breath] that there's a great opportunity to do that. But here's the deal, you gotta want to find common ground. You know, there are lots of people that want to fight.
<Sync time="2241.033"/>
It is not I, I and I feel naive and silly about this, but I thought everybody wanted to find common ground. That is just not true. There are some people
<Sync time="2248.411"/>
who believe that they can win, and that they will have power and they will have money, or they will have opportunity when they win and other people lose,
<Sync time="2257.022"/>
a zero sum game. It's actually a strategy that some people have. And that is a, that is an uncomfortable fact. There are some of us that believe that, no,
<Sync time="2265.33"/>
all of us do better when all of us win. And you got to be committed to that, because if you're not committed to that it's kind of hard
<Sync time="2272.951"/>
to design something that brings people together, when you when some people want to design something that keep us apart.
<Sync time="2278.095"/>
And I think that is a political battle, political in the, in the democratic sense of the word like you have to win in the marketplace of ideas.
<Sync time="2286.316"/>
That's got to be a community conversation about what our values are. And I suppose that you do that friend to friend, neighbor to neighbor,
<Sync time="2294.677"/>
baseball team to baseball team, volleyball team to volleyball team, church, to church, politician to politician, community to community. You got to build it,
<Sync time="2302.615"/>
knit it together, all the way down from the ground all the way up, if you want it to hold when we find ourselves on distress.
<Sync time="2308.98"/>
And, #uh you know, because that's when it breaks. If it's not strong it then if, if the safety net of communion is not strong,

when the stress comes and the hard times come, it's easy to rip that stuff apart. And you don't want to be there. You want to be resilient and strong,
<Sync time="2323.272"/>
so you can take whatever comes your way. Because the values are the things that at the end of the day, will outweigh the anger and the frustration
<Sync time="2329.25"/>
and the anxiety. And unfortunately, the safety net from that perspective, the de~ the safety net of democracy is really frail right now, and I think we have to be purposeful intentional about putting it back together.

Mitch Landrieu's effort is one of dozens, maybe hundreds, that have attempted to chip away the problems

There are two ways change happens in the world. One is through revolutionary moments, marches, or speeches, or events that push history forward all at once.
<Sync time="2369.06"/>
The other way is through the small slow grind of daily life, running into people at the grocery store, talking to your neighbor,
<Sync time="2379.425"/>
stepping outside your comfortable place to understand another human being. Nobody really notices that change when it's happening.

You just wake up one day and it's happened. It's not nearly as fast or as final as most of us would like,
<Sync time="2396.211"/>
but every conversation is like a wave against the rocks. One wave doesn't do much, but enough waves turn the hardest rocks into sand.
