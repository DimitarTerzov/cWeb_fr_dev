You know, it's kinda funny. #uh No, not really. You know, some of my enduring rich friends at Steve (()) call me Tilly, but that's about it.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="40.866" endTime="42.971">

So, so you're Tilman Tilly. [laugh]

Tilman is my name.

We, we we're not one of your rich friends, so I guess I can't call Tilly.

Right. 'Cause to you it's Tilman.

I was gonna say something really stupid. I was gonna say, you probably get tired of being called billionaire, but that would be dumb.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="53.631" endTime="60.243">
<Sync time="53.631"/>
No, believe it or not, sometimes I've even, I even tell people, gosh, don't refer to me that way. You know, just, my name's Tilman, though.

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="60.243" endTime="61.004">

[laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="61.456" endTime="79.859">
<Sync time="61.456"/>
Well, now you're the new owner of the Houston Rockets. We won't even get into all the emotion of that because those stories will be written and talked about on this podcast. We'll go into a little, a different tack on it, so to speak. 
<Sync time="73.003"/>
You were, you've been a fan. You've been on the sidelines at games, et cetera. What, what does basketball actually mean to you?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="79.859" endTime="107.793">
<Sync time="79.859"/>
You know, I, I, I'm a fan, okay? And I was a partner with Charlie Thomas from eighty-four to ninety-four. And, and then with Les, #uh, you know, I've been advisory director of the team and, and sat there for many years with Les. 
<Sync time="94.272"/>
But I was never involved in, in the basketball. And, and, #uh, you know, I, I, I'm just a fan. And, and I've been growing my own business and, you know, in a way, I thank God that I didn't get the team twenty-four years ago~ 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="107.793" endTime="109.676">
<Sync time="107.793"/>
You, and, and you tried, you tried hard, didn't you.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="109.676" endTime="137.157">
<Sync time="109.676"/>
I, I tried hard and, and, but, but if that would've happened, maybe I wouldn't have built, you know, the Landry's empire that I did. And, and now I have that and this. And you know, things work out for reasons sometimes. And, and, #uh, you know, here we all are. And, #uh, you know, 
<Sync time="124.409"/>
I would hope you all are happy that a Houston guy, you know, got it. And, and, #uh, who, who's been around and, and loves the city and appreciates it and, and, #uh, you know, I'm, I'm thrilled you all, you all know that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="137.157" endTime="150.882">
<Sync time="137.157"/>
It came by rather quickly and I know there were other suitors in, in the Chase Ford and you know, to a certain extent, Les want~ likes it that it's a local guy getting it. But you, you did have to outbid some people to get there, right?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="150.882" endTime="193.129">
<Sync time="150.882"/>
You know, very much so. And, and it happened quickly 'cause you know, I pushed it to happen quickly. #uh You know, I, I, I went out there and said this is what I'll pay for and, and I'll put up money hard, no financing contingency, 
<Sync time="163.236"/>
and I'll close before the season starts. And while these other people are talking about how they're gonna do it, you know, I, I went out and got it done. I think a lot of people, you know, tried to dig into the numbers and say, how do you pay this if this is what it makes. 
<Sync time="177.062"/>
That had nothing to do with it. But I knew that, okay. What it makes has nothing to do. Is it worth one point seven or two point five. And, and #uh, it was really just to get to the number that I knew Les would sell for. 
<Sync time="189.217"/>
And the number that I went in with is the number that I paid for. I don't play games.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="193.129" endTime="195.202">
<Sync time="193.129"/>
I~ It helps to, it helps to have a lot of cash sitting around too though 'cause~
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="195.202" endTime="244.963">
<Sync time="195.202"/>
You know, I mean I didn't have that much sitting around but I, but I had the ability to get it through my other companies 'cause you can only have a two fifteen. And so it kind of separates the men from the boys right there. 
<Sync time="208.177"/>
And you know, you have these people talking about, you know, having, oh I'm going to go put a group together, we're partners or whatever. What's a different world today, when you're not paying six hundred for a team, but you're paying two billion for a team. 
<Sync time="219.463"/>
'Cause you can go get a partner that, that you know is going to put up a hundred million dollars. Well, he's only going to get, you know, ten percent of the team. No, no, no, five percent of the team, five percent. 
<Sync time="231.789"/>
So if somebody puts up five percent (()) It's no longer about percentage, it's about well, God, I'm put up a hundred million dollars, that's real money I want to say so. And so limited partners don't work for this gig anymore. Okay. They don't work.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="244.963" endTime="253.226">
<Sync time="244.963"/>
So to me, very interesting, different, unique, probably the most electric press conference we've had in this building and since, since it opened. And #uh
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="253.226" endTime="253.86">
<Sync time="253.226"/>
Really?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="253.86" endTime="293.89">
<Sync time="253.86"/>
Yeah, with, without question. Yeah. #uh Talking &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; and I mean all over the board, but the one thing that stood out the most to me, and I, and I, I want to go a little deeper on this. As you said, if I had two point two billion dollars to spend on a &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; team 
<Sync time="266.882"/>
or a major league baseball team, you would do the &lt;initial&gt; NBA &lt;/initial&gt;. You mentioned the, the risk involved in the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; and maybe, you know, hearing from friends and people in that world that, hey, we don't know where the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; is going to be 
<Sync time="275.928"/>
in fifty or sixty years and yeah, baseball is great and you have all the games and the revenue, but baseball has an older crowd and they're struggling. Go into that a little deeper. I thought that was, that was very, very interesting. 
<Sync time="287.475"/>
Especially the comments about the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; that you would not, if you could, you would not, you would, you would buy an &lt;initial&gt; NBA &lt;/initial&gt; team, not an &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; team.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="293.89" endTime="296.307">
<Sync time="293.89"/>
So you always want to go after the controversial side.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="296.307" endTime="302.288">
<Sync time="296.307"/>
Not controversial, just, just, ve~ very interesting. Very Interesting. I, I love the honesty there. You would~ you wouldn't hear many people say that.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="302.288" endTime="456.655">
<Sync time="302.288"/>
You know, I'm very honest. Okay. Maybe too honest. Okay. #um But I think it's true. I mean, I, I didn't not state anything that everybody doesn't write about and talk about in, in a small room of people. Okay. 
<Sync time="316.839"/>
And &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; people even think it, #uh, the most experienced sportscasters and followers in this country in, in private meetings when, 
<Sync time="327.75"/>
when I've let it be known that, that I have some really good friends in y'all's business that are, that are some national guys and have said, you know, watch out for the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt;. 
<Sync time="337.286"/>
And, and, you know, it ain't gonna happen in my lifetime. Okay. But the asset that I was going to buy as a sports team was going to be a generational asset. Okay. 
<Sync time="347.582"/>
And especially if I could do it in my hometown. Because my kids grew up sitting in those seats right there. And so, so yes, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; 's scary. I mean, I mean, 
<Sync time="359.429"/>
kids don't want their, their kids to play football anymore. I mean, look at this weekend, what happened. When you look at, it wasn't even a, you know, a head injury. But, but, but but for, for the, for the, the Giants 
<Sync time="373.187"/>
to, to lose Odell and Brandon and, and for the Texans, you know, to lose our two great players. I mean, it's a, it's a tough sport. And you're not just spraining an ankle like we do in basketball. 
<Sync time="387.227"/>
#uh And you're still seeing some, some monstrous hits. So i~ i~ it is a little scary when you start paying two billion dollars and you're not paying five hundred million. And then baseball's has its whole other issue. Okay. 
<Sync time="399.099"/>
It has lost a lot of its fan base and that is a fact. This isn't Tilman Fertitta saying it. I would love to have owned the Houston Astros. You know, I grew up watching the Houston Astros. 
<Sync time="410.161"/>
And, and if Jim Crane called me tomorrow to sell 'em, I would try to buy 'em. But, but when you look at it in a box, the &lt;initial&gt; NBA &lt;/initial&gt; is where it's at guys. 
<Sync time="421.862"/>
Okay. And that, that's a fact. That's the fan base that's growing. People love the energy that you recognize the players. You have the energy on the floor of, of the stars that like to sit out there and watch the game.
<Sync time="434.878"/>
And we will try to bring a little showtime to Houston and, and #uh, it just, people feel connected with &lt;initial&gt; NBA &lt;/initial&gt; players more than they do the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; players. And I think the, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; MLB &lt;/initial&gt; players. 
<Sync time="448.093"/>
They pick one or two in the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; and they are super superstars. Okay. But, but they're the team. We're, in the &lt;initial&gt; NBA &lt;/initial&gt;, everybody knows.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="456.655" endTime="474.348">
<Sync time="456.655"/>
We will ask you one thing though. #um You talked about those professional leagues. How irritated are you still that the University of Houston, your university, 
<Sync time="465.951"/>
I mean, I know guns up too, but your university is shut out of the big monopoly that is the big five in college sports.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="474.348" endTime="492.218">
<Sync time="474.348"/>
You know, I, I don't usually get involved in causes and #um, and, and, and, and pi~ just because I'm in the media a lot and I give interviews about business and whatever, 
<Sync time="485.107"/>
I usually am not outspoken about a controversial subject. Okay. But that's one that I went out there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="492.218" endTime="492.756">
<Sync time="492.218"/>
Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="492.756" endTime="549.106">
<Sync time="492.756"/>
And I said, I've got a problem with this. Okay. Number one, there's something wrong with contracts. The college coaches, when I sign a five year, let's just say a fifteen year contract, three million a year for five years, simple math. 
<Sync time="506.479"/>
And if I wanna fire you after the first year, I've got to write you out a check for twelve million. But if you decide to jump schools on me, you get to buy out for a million dollars. Okay.
<Sync time="519.255"/>
And you get to move on down the line. Okay. Well, when I, I was happy for Tom Herman, if I was Tom Herman and I had a chance to go to the University of Texas, you can't pass that up. And I congratulated him. Okay. 
<Sync time="532.744"/>
But I said no more of this with college football contracts. And when I raised hell about that, if you notice all the new contracts are different now. 
<Sync time="540.329"/>
We were letting these, we were letting these lawyer agents come in and dick to these &lt;initial&gt; AD &lt;/initial&gt; s dictate to them saying
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="549.106" endTime="550.612">
<Sync time="549.106"/>
That too. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="550.612" endTime="583.875">
<Sync time="550.612"/>
Right. But they dictate to, right, right. Caught myself though. All right, but dictate to these &lt;initial&gt; AD &lt;/initial&gt; s we won't even interview for the job. Okay. But when they started saying all these coaches, one at the &lt;initial&gt; U &lt;/initial&gt; of &lt;initial&gt; H &lt;/initial&gt; job, it is a prestigious job 
<Sync time="564.739"/>
for being a non~ you know, (()) O~ okay. I said, don't interview. If you think you're going to have a contract that you can get out of. Don't even come here. 
<Sync time="574.34"/>
And, and, and, and if you look at all the new contracts that are signed with the new coaches,their buy out isn't so cheap anymore. If they want out, well you're gonna pay us.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="583.875" endTime="587.446">
<Sync time="583.875"/>
Yeah, if you come into a job planning for the next one, you know.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="587.446" endTime="588.236">
<Sync time="587.446"/>
I~ it's &lt;initial&gt; BS &lt;/initial&gt;.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="588.236" endTime="588.555">
<Sync time="588.236"/>
Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="588.555" endTime="615.848">
<Sync time="588.555"/>
And so we put an end to that. And now let's answer your question. It was the biggest ramrod railroad ever. So you, you, you're gonna tell all these schools to tell us about you and, and, and come to the dance and let us check you out. 
<Sync time="602.314"/>
But last I looked is, I think everybody knows about the University of Houston. I think everybody knows about the University of Cincinnati. #uh Everybody knows about Memphis, #uh, this is a private. Go get on an airplane and go walk around our campus.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="615.848" endTime="616.097">
<Sync time="615.848"/>
Right.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="616.097" endTime="662.615">
<Sync time="616.097"/>
Go on the internet and look at where we are academically, that we're five beta, and that we're this and we're that. And then you're gonna say, oh, none of you girls are pretty enough or none of you guys are pretty enough, okay? 
<Sync time="627.461"/>
And so when I go up there for the interview, and the chairman of the committee is not there and all they have is the commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner or an outside lawyer and they took up my busy time. Okay.
<Sync time="639.246"/>
They never had any intention. It was a &lt;initial&gt; PR &lt;/initial&gt; move. Because how could you say the University of Houston and neither Cincinnati or Memphis or &lt;initial&gt; SMU &lt;/initial&gt; did not qualify to be in the big twelve? 
<Sync time="650.793"/>
You're in Houston, Texas and every one of those schools would love to come down here and play us and fill up our stadium or Energy stadium. All right, Joe, get me going on that?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="662.615" endTime="664.918">
<Sync time="662.615"/>
#uh Yeah, we got you going. That's good. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk4" startTime="664.918" endTime="673.735">
<Sync time="664.918"/>
We got the Houston Rockets. This is easy. I know what I know. I know what I don't know. I've got a great management team here, and they're gonna teach me a lot about basketball.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="673.735" endTime="675.522">
<Sync time="673.735"/>
Oh, we wish you a lot of luck. Thank you, sir.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="675.522" endTime="677.007">
<Sync time="675.522"/>
Thank you for your time, Tilman.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="677.007" endTime="691.994">
<Sync time="677.007"/>
Well, he did indeed bring it this time a little passion is, #uh, you know, Tilman Fertitta there talking about. He'd finally, got him a little riled up with some passion about his University of Houston Cougars and how the big twelve railroaded him. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="691.994" endTime="693.108">
<Sync time="691.994"/>
Ram~ Ramrodded.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="693.108" endTime="698.785">
<Sync time="693.108"/>
Ramrodded and, and, well, he's another word earlier about something else, but, you know, we'll, we'll leave that alone for now.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="698.785" endTime="701.454">
<Sync time="698.785"/>
I think we just learned how Tilman Fertitta made his money.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="701.454" endTime="702.401">
<Sync time="701.454"/>
[laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="702.401" endTime="720.154">
<Sync time="702.401"/>
Yeah, and he, you, you can, you can see Jerome behind the podium talking with us. Everything going on. There is, there is a passion there. There was a drive, there was an intensity, there was a vision and, 
<Sync time="714.691"/>
you know, whether you're Jim Crane, whether, Bob McNair is not that passionate but in, in the business world, 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="720.154" endTime="721.454">
<Sync time="720.154"/>
And, and he's passionate about his money.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="721.454" endTime="726.627">
<Sync time="721.454"/>
In, in, in the business world he is. And you could see it with Tilman Fertitta and what he just brought for us
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="726.627" endTime="742.642">
<Sync time="726.627"/>
You know, and, and, and actually I, I thought, I think Bob McNair is that. In one thing Bob McNair is older than #uh the other owners that you mentioned there, Tilman and Jim Crane, 
<Sync time="737.759"/>
#uh, and Bob's been around a bit but, #uh, Bob gets, Bob gets fired up and he~
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="742.642" endTime="743.285">
<Sync time="742.642"/>
Oh, he gets~
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="743.285" endTime="754.407">
<Sync time="743.285"/>
But one thing that he does do is, he presents a certain demeanor that he wants us to get whatever he says. That's, that's actually what he wants us to see.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="754.407" endTime="767.849">
<Sync time="754.407"/>
But, oh, he's very, very fired up. But I'm saying that Tilman, and this is, this is what stood out to me more than anything during the press conference and speaking to us. Tilman will take that filter off. Jim, Jim Crane is very, very passionate, but if you, if you put Jim Crane,
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="767.849" endTime="769.045">
<Sync time="767.849"/>
He's, he's laid back.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="769.045" endTime="770.365">
<Sync time="769.045"/>
And he's, he's laid back, right?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="770.365" endTime="771.563">
<Sync time="770.365"/>
But he's, but he's a golfer.

<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="771.563" endTime="772.047">

[laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="772.047" endTime="776.431">
<Sync time="772.047"/>
Golfer~ golfers have to be calm and they have to be cool and they can't, you know.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="776.431" endTime="794.517">
<Sync time="776.431"/>
~he played high-level baseball. You know, he, he can do the intense thing. To, I, my points is with Tilman, it's off. He's, he's going to, #uh, he says, I'm Tilman Fertitta 
<Sync time="785.254"/>

What differences do you see even just now, you know, a couple of hours into the official Tilman Fertitta era, differences between him and, not the other owners but Les Alexander the former rockets owners specifically?

<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="836.011" endTime="875.508">
<Sync time="836.011"/>
The thing that stood out to me toward the end of Les's tenure, and it's, it's interesting because it~ it's, #uh, it~ it's a conflict in the sense that he was very, very hands-on and he was very driven and they go out and they get Chris Paul and 
<Sync time="849.919"/>
they locked down Daryl Morey and he, he created this path out of here for the next guy to come in to take this over and for everything to work out. But in public, and he went out it with a media little after D'Antoni hire and, and James getting, you know, s~ some 
<Sync time="863.48"/>
#uh people criticizing James. He stood up for his guy. But Les was very, very more so than Jim Crane, more so than anyone else, very laid back. That last press, that last press conference when Chris Paul was introduced, 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="875.508" endTime="875.92">

Uh-huh.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="875.92" endTime="885.353">

Les sat in the second row, wore like, #uh, a thermal shirt, baggy jeans. And if you stood in the back and you didn't know that was Les Alexan~ Alexander, you~
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="885.353" endTime="886.026">

You wouldn't know, he was there.

<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="886.026" endTime="915.914">

You would, you would, you wouldn't have thought that he somehow stumbled into a press conference and when he was actually just walking by Toyota Center, and, and somehow ended up in that room. 
<Sync time="894.733"/>
Tilman Fertitta comes out in the suit, takes the pictures, this was his day. And, and, and, and the thing is, is Les was very, very committed on the court. I mean, he was barking in a refs ear [laugh] during a playoff game on national &lt;initial&gt; TV &lt;/initial&gt;.
<Sync time="908.749"/>
So I'm not in any way saying Les wasn't hands-on. Les was very hands-on. But in public, it was very much, hey, I decided this, this is~
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="915.914" endTime="921.924">

<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="921.924" endTime="923.225">

He knew it was coming.

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="923.225" endTime="934.53">

He must have. I mean, I know, no one else seemed to have known until, you know, Ted Brown had said, he called him, you know, one morning and said, I'm ready to do something and~

<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="935.17" endTime="960.859">
<Sync time="935.17"/>
~and they and they started making the moves. But if he wasn't ready to start changing his life, he would have been front and center with the Chris Paul #uh press conference. He had been there taking the photos with the new acquisition, the future Hall of Famer, 
<Sync time="948.535"/>
the, you know, multiple perennial All-Star joining the roster as Les has been with every other superstar he brought into the team, over his twenty-four years as an owner. That should have, maybe that should have been a hint.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="960.859" endTime="964.19">

That, that, that, that should have been and it actually stood out, and I think I tweeted about it that, you know.

And, and I sat right behind him, and, and it's one of those things. It's, it's hindsight much like, you know, a D'Antoni hire [laugh] or Bill O'Brien and Tom Savage. But you look at it now and, and that was. It was very, very telling. And here's the thing with Tilman, there's, there's not gonna be any of that. 
<Sync time="978.104"/>
I mean, this, this is Tilman Fertitta's team. It is now, it's his arena. It's the branding it's, it's the, it's the whole Tilman Fertitta &lt;initial&gt; INC &lt;/initial&gt; world that, that's going on and we, we saw that in the interviews.
<Sync time="990.932"/>
But you know what, none of it's gonna matter, Jerome. If, if, if they, if, if, if, if you don't win. And we're gonna talk about this right now and it is interesting. 
<Sync time="998.99"/>
And he's gonna, he's gonna brand the hell of that arena, but it all comes down to, can you take this a step further? Can you find some way to beat the Warriors? Can, can you do with the Rockets were not able to do it after nineteen ninety-five?

Yeah. I, and, and I'm gonna argue with this. Will, #uh, we'll have plenty (()) but you use the wrong phrase again. You're like the hindsight, knows not hindsight. You were saying, Tom Savage. Well, I was saying Tom Savage wasn't gonna be the guy that couldn't play and it wasn't,

If, if, if Eric Gordon was that good at his, at, at that position, why get Chris Paul? I mean, not, I, I'm not say~

But they gave away three guys to get one guy, so they didn't get deeper with Chris Paul. They got better.

We don't know how good this team is yet. I, I, I think, I think, you, #uh, see, last year, you were sitting here at this time telling me they weren't good enough, they weren't gonna win (()) the game.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1434.679" endTime="1439.264">

Because they, because they fired their coach and won forty, they won the forty-first game on the last game of the year.

I told you then they'd~ No I said they would win way more than fifty games. It wouldn't even be a debate, and I was right about that. I know my basketball here. When it comes to this team, we don't know what it'll be. 
<Sync time="1451.777"/>
I think it'll be a mid-fifties win team, perhaps even closer to sixty, but I don't know if this team can beat Oklahoma City. I don't know what Oklahoma City's gonna do until I, till we see them, right.

But I'm, but you're saying it's a guarantee they're the second best team, end of discussion. I, I think that's a bit premature.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk3" startTime="1470.958" endTime="1498.049">
<Sync time="1470.958"/>
I, I wouldn't think anything otherwise right now. I would, I would have Golden State, Houston, and then it's a mix right, Tony Parker's not coming back immediately. Then it's a mix of San Antonio, #uh, Utah's down, Memphis is down. The, the West is, #uh, 
<Sync time="1485.199"/>
the, the West is not that loaded right now. So Oklahoma City's a three or a four but, I, I, everyone that, everything I've seen, everything that I've read, no one's saying Oklahoma City right now is the number two team in the West.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk2" startTime="1498.049" endTime="1518.169">
<Sync time="1498.049"/>
I, I understand that. My point is, the number two team that you're claiming is the Houston Rockets, isn't hands-down better than the Oklahoma City is right now. We don't, so, it, 
<Sync time="1509.54"/>
I can't sit here and go, if the Rockets don't make it to the Western Conference Finals, they did a bad job, and that's what you're saying. And I'm saying, I don't, I don't, we don't, we can't~

No, if, if you do what they did last year, and you add Chris Paul and then you go out and you get a &lt;initial&gt; P.J. &lt;/initial&gt; Tucker and a Mbah a Moute, and, and Tarik Black. And you, you have, you have, Nene and Clint Capela and Eric Gordon. You have a coach of the year. You have Daryl Morey pulling on the, all the strings. 
<Sync time="1538.011"/>
You have a, an owner who's willing to do whatever it takes and you, and you win fifty-plus last year and you should've been in the Western Conference Finals, and you can't get there this year, this goes back to the original thing. Is Mike D'Antoni the right guy?

I know how many games I think this team can win. That wasn't the, that wasn't, that's not what we're debating here the last three minutes. I don't know that this team is clearly the second best in the Western Conference. That's what I'm saying. I do~ I don't, I don't, I don't know.

Well, I do know. If they don't, it is, it, it will be very disappointing, and here's the thing, let's go back to the Tilman Fertitta. How is Tilman Fertitta gonna handle it when he has a Chris Paul, 
<Sync time="1619.998"/>
and he has a James Harden, and Eric Gordon, and Clint Capela, and Nene and Ryan Anderson and Trent~ look at [laugh] They, they have, you're sitting there telling me, do they have eleven players? They, they've got the second deepest roster in the &lt;initial&gt; NBA &lt;/initial&gt; right now.
<Sync time="1631.995"/>
We haven't even talked about Trevor Ariza and how will Tilman Fertitta handle it if this team falls short? That, that, that will be very, very interesting to me.
