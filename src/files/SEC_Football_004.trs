Welcome in to the latest episode of that &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; podcast. I'm your host, Michael Brandon. I go by &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; Mike on Twitter 
<Sync time="90.66"/>
and I'm joined as always by my cousin Shane, who goes by Big Orange Evolves on Twitter. What are you up to, you big Tennessee homer?
<Sync time="99.315"/>
[noise] 
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="100.304" endTime="109.611">
<Sync time="100.304"/>
[laugh] Hey, buddy how about them balls? [laugh] Just kidding. I don't I don't know yet. This could be a sad beer, we ain't watch the game yet.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="109.611" endTime="209.092">
<Sync time="109.611"/>
Yeah, so we're recording before the Tennessee game. Then we're gonna do our little post game afterwards so, #uh, Shane is either gonna be happy drunk or angry drunk by the time you get this podcast. 
<Sync time="120.888"/>
It's it remains a mystery to both of us so we'll see how that one goes. But, #uh, before we get to that with Shane the big day here for the Gator Bowl, we gotta recap the Sugar Bowl as promised, you know that game was so damn late 
<Sync time="133.323"/>
that #uh we didn't get a chance to record since we watched it so, gonna do that here. And of course Georgia came away with an impressive twenty six to fourteen win.And this was a nice overall win Shane, a lot of people picking Baylor to win this game. 
<Sync time="147.894"/>
I know they were the, #uh, Georgia was the favorite and you look at on paper, you know, Georgia should smash this team but with so many players out, I think it really says a lot for Kirby Smart in his program that they came out and dominated the way it did. 
<Sync time="161.649"/>
I mean, this thing was nineteen to zero at halftime. George Pickens, if you're a Georgia fan, you gotta be fired up about, you know, arguably one of the best receivers in the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; only being a sophomore on your side next season. 
<Sync time="175.655"/>
#uh And then I you know, I was kind of impressed by Baylor. I thought they were a tough physical team here and they really kind of came out. I thought they made some great halftime adjustments, they came right out, scored a touchdown, 
<Sync time="188.347"/>
kind of, #uh, they scored fourteen in the third, but then Kirby and them, they stole the momentum back with that big fake field goal that led to another score there by Georgia. And after that, that I mean that was that was all she wrote. 
<Sync time="201.955"/>
I know the score was twenty six fourteen but aside from that third quarter, I mean, Georgia just completely dominated this one.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="209.092" endTime="255.972">
<Sync time="209.092"/>
Yeah, man, kind of, but I was a little scared there at second half I was like, oh, oh, don't let these boys get back into it but I was surprised man. I mean, this is the one I was most worried about going into the bowl game. 
<Sync time="221.598"/>
And it's just with everybody sitting out and it just felt like they weren't gonna get up for this thing and, #uh, I was honestly really surprised with the performance that we saw, #uh, mainly Pickens and #uh Zeus dude, 
<Sync time="235.076"/>
man I'm telling you that, I've I've seen some great running this year but there are some times man, it it it just seems like we should have we should have seen a little bit more of Zamir White because he is just 
<Sync time="247.469"/>
a big [laugh] physical pounding bag and I just behind this offense I'm surprised we didn't get to use him more this year.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="255.972" endTime="348.573">
<Sync time="255.972"/>
Yeah, he really was. He showcased himself as kind of that battering ram that they've kind of been missing you know, so you gotta wonder where he's been most of the season. I know he's been in there, but maybe he just needed that feature role, needed those eighteen carries, Swift only got the, 
<Sync time="270.912"/>
#uh, one carry he did come in. I thought it was a great play call there by Georgia staff on, #uh, I believe it was the first time D'Andre Swift was in the game, they did the flea flicker that that paid off a big time there for Georgia. 
<Sync time="284.369"/>
#uh That was great. And then of course, we had the reworked offensive line because both the tackles, Thomas and Wilson, both sitting out, both going to the pros and we had Ben Cleveland academically ineligible, 
<Sync time="296.496"/>
Matt Luke in his first game replacing Sam Pittman as the offensive line coach, dude, he was firing people up. I've seen all over Twitter Georgia fans are are, they're just in love with Matt Luke already, really good showing there for their new coach there, 
<Sync time="310.573"/>
and I think his hire I kind of mentioned this on Twitter. I think his hire suggests that Georgia is gonna kind of open things up a little bit more on offense this off season, because not to say he can't run a offensive line in a pro-style set here, but 
<Sync time="325.142"/>
his history is more with the spread offense there at Ole Miss. So, I'm looking forward to Kirby Smart. I think he's gotta take a page out of Edward ((Jones)) book, not saying they completely have to go to the five wide and everything because they've they've got some good backs, but 
<Sync time="338.76"/>
you gotta open it up a little bit more and I think if Kirby learned that lesson, I think Georgia is gonna be you know, once again, a national title contender.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="348.573" endTime="364.906">
<Sync time="348.573"/>
Absolutely. And if the country doesn't know George Pickens now, I mean this this, this was just a glimpse of what Georgia can become in the future and dude he is, 
<Sync time="358.955"/>
I mean, now they can start a season, I know he's a true freshman but man, he looked like a grown ass man out there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="364.906" endTime="401.59">
<Sync time="364.906"/>
Yeah, they've got some other young talented guys that maybe just weren't ready for the spotlight yet but if they open it up, maybe they'll get that opportunity next season. So, it's not gonna be just a one-man show. That's been kind of the issue there with &lt;initial&gt; LSU &lt;/initial&gt; for years, just saying. 
<Sync time="378.11"/>
They got all this talent, they're not utilizing it, kind of starting to see some of that, that's kind of why I used that similarity to LSU, Georgia is kind of in a similar position. So, I'm really looking forward to see if Georgia opens it up. I think they have to, 
<Sync time="391.501"/>
you know, they can win the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; like this, or the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; East, at least and contend for the conference title, but just don't know if they can win the national title unless they open it up a little bit more.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="401.59" endTime="452.561">
<Sync time="401.59"/>
Yeah, for sure or at least have the ability to turn it on. It seems like they tried to do that with &lt;initial&gt; LSU &lt;/initial&gt; and they just weren't, you know, didn't have that chemistry quite. I mean, we had the drops, and of course Pickens was out first half of that game and, 
<Sync time="414.619"/>
#um, there was a lot of factors but, you know, you gotta have that ability to turn it on because there's gonna be times when you're down, there's gonna be times that you need to speed it up and open it up and just keep the defense on their heels and, #um, you know, 
<Sync time="427.754"/>
I love I love old school offense, man, you know, I I love big linemen. I love just grinding it out and you know, something that you've seen a little bit more with Kentucky, you know, just at the end of the game when the defense is just gassed and you're, 
<Sync time="442.196"/>
[laugh] you know, those little two, three yard runs become fifteen, twenty-yard runs and, and that works but there's sometimes you need to open it up and that's what I hope Georgia does going forward.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="452.561" endTime="480.348">
<Sync time="452.561"/>
Mhm. All right, Shane. Well, let's kick it over to the postgame comments here from Kirby Smart talking about and this is a really interesting comment I thought on the disease that's hurt &lt;initial&gt; UGA &lt;/initial&gt; in the past on his decision to run that fake field goal. 
<Sync time="466.617"/>
We said he kinda chickened out at one point, decided to run it the second field goal here and then, #uh, some comments here from Jake Fromm on Pickens and then Pickens kinda talking and he credited Jake Fromm for a lot of his progression this season.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk15" startTime="480.348" endTime="499.242">
<Sync time="480.348"/>
#uh Coach Moore can you just talk, #uh, it's, #uh, Lewis Sean, #uh, &lt;initial&gt; DJ &lt;/initial&gt; Daniel lead the team in tackles, George Pickens leads a team and rece~. receptions. 
<Sync time="489.108"/>
#uh Zamir leads in rush, I mean a lot of young pups kinda, #uh, stepped up today. Can you just talk about that and and sort of looking forward to having a lot of those guys back next year?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk16" startTime="499.242" endTime="559.275">
<Sync time="499.242"/>
[lipsmack] Yeah, I mean, to be honest with you, the future is only bright if those guys continue to work because there's a disease and, #uh, #uh, #uh, that creeps in at Georgia where kids believe they're better than they are 
<Sync time="512.884"/>
and they they read their own press clippings and, #uh our team chaplain did a wonderful job today expressing that in a a verse and I can't quote the verse, Jake probably can, but you know, he he basically said that, 
<Sync time="525.379"/>
#uh when you start reading about yourself and believing your own press clippings is when you start to fall. And those kids that you just mentioned are tremendous players, but they'll only be as good as they can be, if they stay as hungry as they are. 
<Sync time="537.415"/>
And when you're not hungry, you become average and, #uh some of that I think has affected us in the past and we've got to find a way in this program to to not let that creep in and keep that same hunger you have as a young player, 
<Sync time="550.643"/>
cause we've had it happen to several guys that were really hungry and then they become full. And you can't become full when you go play in the big teams we play against.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk15" startTime="559.275" endTime="574.641">
<Sync time="559.275"/>
Jake and George, #uh, #uh, appears like you guys got a little bit of chemistry and that it was working pretty well, especially in the first half. 
<Sync time="567.286"/>
Jake, can you talk about it first and George can you talk about that and, and having George back next year would that be incentive for you to return?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk18" startTime="574.641" endTime="603.886">
<Sync time="574.641"/>
Yeah, #uh, man, I love George. #uh George is a great teammate, #uh a great football player, #uh but what I love about George is he he loves football. #uh He loves going out, #uh competing, #uh I can say, 
<Sync time="585.95"/>
#uh for him showing up at practice he's the same guy, [laugh] same competitor every single day, #uh, and I know I love it I know coach loves it, 
<Sync time="593.454"/>
#um, but he he's a competitor he goes out and competes and so you know seeing him do something like he did, #uh, today, #uh, no surprise to us and he's just going out playing the game he loves.
<Sync time="602.504"/>
[no-speech]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk19" startTime="603.886" endTime="619.251">
<Sync time="603.886"/>
I also agree with what Jake said, but it's really just him, he pushed me every day, Coach Smart push me every day to be the player I am today. So, just being connected with him at practice all the time is really just the best thing.
<Sync time="618.162"/>
[no-speech]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk15" startTime="619.251" endTime="627.242">
<Sync time="619.251"/>
Kirby was that fake, #uh, field goal there earlier and why why call that then the second time I guess?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk16" startTime="627.242" endTime="671.6">
<Sync time="627.242"/>
[lipsmack] Well, I wanted to call it the first time and I chickened out, and then I wanted to call it the second time and then I chickened out, and so the third time was the charm because we didn't wanna do it in the long run in distance, we wanna do it on a manageable well, 
<Sync time="638.518"/>
you know, you got a fourth and two and it's there and then you got a fourth and three and it's there, and you don't know how many of those situations you're gonna have cause it's not a play that's gonna work on fourth and really long, but we had worked it hard, Coach Faulkner and his staff had, #uh, put it together and we thought it was there 
<Sync time="651.388"/>
and we've kicked so many field goals this year that you've gotta have you gotta score touchdowns, and I thought that would give us the momentum if we got it and I felt like they were gonna score points, and we gotta score touchdowns, we can't, you know, keep getting threes and, #uh, 
<Sync time="664.64"/>
Jake did a great job e~~ executing it and Eli Wolfe had one of the prime, well, he and Charlie did an unbelievable job blocking that play.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="671.6" endTime="767.082">
<Sync time="671.6"/>
Alright, Shane so, Georgia fans fired up after this big Sugar Bowl win, and I did my best to fire him up, Shane. [laugh] I didn't even that was not even my intention but I don't know, once again, these comments from Kirby, 
<Sync time="686.115"/>
if you just wanna take him at face value, I see what you're saying like it, everyone is pissed off that I'm pointing out the fact that, #uh, you know, Kirby's putting it on his players to do the work and not read their press clippings and everything 
<Sync time="697.689"/>
but I think that's just such an obvious statement I mean, you could say that for any any team in any conference, particularly the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt;, you know, at face value, those are not comments that would raise my eyebrow. But 
<Sync time="710.995"/>
you know, what was it that he said after the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; championship game, I mean, it's he really did kinda put it on his receivers and all we lost some guys, these guys you know aren't ready, and then 
<Sync time="723.441"/>
the previous &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; Championship what was it, it was you know the crazy fake punt that didn't work and he's saying well it was there, it just wasn't executed. And, #uh, then you can go back to, hell, even the Hail Mary play with 
<Sync time="738.079"/>
Tennessee, Dobbs, all those years ago when, #uh, Georgia got a penalty on after their touchdown. He put he put it on that guy I mean, I see what Kirby is saying but this is his damn job. I mean you could put it on these guys all you want, it's your job to get them, 
<Sync time="752.589"/>
you know, focused and ready. And he's saying it here again it's on these players to focus, get their mind right. There's a lot of truth to that, but after a big win like this, I just don't, I just don't like this comment from Kirby. What are your thoughts on all of that?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="767.082" endTime="842.886">
<Sync time="767.082"/>
I'm kinda with you, #um, but you gotta remember this you you catch these coaches right after the game, you know, what I'm saying. There's just there's a lot of ether, a lot of excitement and sometimes you say stuff that you probably wish you didn't and, #uh, 
<Sync time="781.399"/>
I I don't like to hear coaches put it on the players, but think of it like a fan man. When you're watching this game, do you think, [laugh] you know, I mean, how many times do you watch do you say, 
<Sync time="791.715"/>
oh man, Kirby's gotta get these guys to check or do you say come on Pickens, what the hell were you doing? You know what I'm saying, it's like. I I don't know it's it's kind of a double-edged sword you kinda wanna but I mean, sometimes it is a blÄŒ ~ ÄŒhe player's fault, 
<Sync time="803.771"/>
but sometimes it's the coaching that got the players in a bad position. So, I don't know. I'm I'm kinda impartial to this thing and, #uh, I'm just impressed with some of the youth that we did see, 
<Sync time="816.765"/>
you know, that came up this game, #uh, that's that's what you wanna see in these bowl games is is a glimpse of the future and #uh the future looks looks great. Now, there's there's some things that Georgia is obviously gonna have to work on 
<Sync time="829.767"/>
and probably Kirby needs to work on his his, #uh, [laugh] you know his postgame speeches, but, #um, this this is, #uh, I don't know. I just thought it was a good good look, a good glimpse into the future.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="842.886" endTime="964.398">
<Sync time="842.886"/>
Yeah, I mean, Georgia is so loaded, they could afford to not have thirteen guys in this game and beat the big twelve runner up handedly. So, I mean, the future is certainly bright. I'm not suggesting it's not, 
<Sync time="854.765"/>
#uh, but one other thing here on Georgia, Shane, I wanted to pick your brain on this because if you caught it there, you know, Jake Fromm was asked about, #uh, Pickens and he complimented his freshman receiver, but at the same time, he was asked in that question, 
<Sync time="867.407"/>
does his presence on the team, does that weigh on your decision at all? He didn't even get into that and I, you know, I'm not making too much out of that, but it is interesting that he just didn't even you know, he could have said 
<Sync time="880.624"/>
anything, you know what I'm focused on this twin or [laugh] that's a decision to be made I mean, he said nothing just acted like the question wasn't asked. And I gotta ask you this, Shane, because all the speculation, now we don't know, 
<Sync time="893.966"/>
but it certainly sounds like Tua is going to come back. Any chance that changes Jake Fromm's decision? I don't know if it does, but hell if you're looking at it like this Shane, 
<Sync time="906.929"/>
Tua coming back next season, Trevor Lawrence is gonna be there, I mean Jake Fromm could have a hell of a season and he's still as long as Tua is healthy and Trevor Lawrence doesn't get hurt, 
<Sync time="919.707"/>
I mean he's not passing those guys up, so I wonder if you're you're sitting there and you're Jake Fromm and saying, you know, I don't know how much he's putting it on the coaching or the new coordinator Coley or anything, although Coley 
<Sync time="932.017"/>
leading up to this game did say you know he put the struggles on himself for Georgia's offense, but I wonder if you're sitting there and you're Jake Fromm and saying 
<Sync time="939.269"/>
[no-speech]
<Sync time="940.542"/>
I know I didn't have quite the year I wanted to have, but hell if I go now, I may be a lock to be a top ten pick whereas if I come back, not saying that he can't still be a top ten pick, 
<Sync time="953.179"/>
quarterbacks tend to go high, but if Trevor Lawrence is there, Tua is there I mean, I I don't know how far or how high Fromm can realistically go with those guys right there.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="964.398" endTime="975.832">
<Sync time="964.398"/>
Let me ask you, man, #um, let's just say, let's, I'm kinda with you on that situation if I'm if I'm, #uh, looking at potential paycheck, I maybe going if Tua comes back.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="975.832" endTime="976.633">
<Sync time="975.832"/>
Uh-huh.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="976.633" endTime="1057.416">
<Sync time="976.633"/>
But if Tua goes I think another factor would be, #uh, would be play calling because I don't think they gave it it seems like toward the end of the season they gave Fromm more opportunities to showcase his arm, 
<Sync time="989.821"/>
they sure the heck didn't do that at the start of this season. So I think that would be weighing on my mind too like, are are we gonna open up, cause here you look and you see, #uh, Joe down here, just airing it out having fun you see you've seen it with Tua, 
<Sync time="1003.052"/>
#uh, you've seen it in these playoff games, man, they're just they're it's a vertical game and Georgia wasn't doing that and you know, Jake's goal is to play in the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; and he's not gonna be able to do that 
<Sync time="1016.112"/>

<Sync time="1029.203"/>
Jake is gonna have more talent next year, better talent, and I think he could, you know, if the coaches put their salesmen hat on and they want Jake back, they could say, hey, listen, we're gonna make this offense about you, not the running game, 
<Sync time="1041.775"/>
the running back game is gonna always be there, it's always gonna be a part of this offense, but we want to, if we're gonna go to this next level, we're gonna have to air it out you've got your weapons list, 
<Sync time="1050.651"/>
we're gonna open this playbook up a little bit for you and I think if a a little bit of recruiting they can get Jake to come back easily.

Yeah, I think that's a really good point so, I mean, there's a lot of unanswered questions there. I think Fromm is gonna have to weigh whether he thinks Coley and the offensive staff, he's gonna get him any better because, 
<Sync time="1068.894"/>
I mean, they certainly do didn't do it this year and if I mean if the staff is intact if the game plan is intact I don't know I think I'm leaving.

Well, speaking of not going, Shane, here, let's jump on then to Tuscaloosa where we had some news here on Thursday where Alabama's outstanding left tackle Alex Leatherwood first team all &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; named by the coaches, 
<Sync time="1101.581"/>
he has announced he will return for his senior season and that's you know interesting on a couple of levels, Shane, cause you gotta figure this guy would be an &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; draft pick certainly. 
<Sync time="1111.877"/>
Now, he could I'm sure he's thinking he's gonna come back and improve his stock, get you know go even higher, hopefully win himself an &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt;, a National Championship, but I also think this helps Tua in his decision cause now you got 
<Sync time="1126.388"/>
your blind side left tackle continuity there, this guy has been playing, you know, consistently since his, basically his freshman season so any chance this helps Tua make his decision here with the left tackle coming back.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1140.74" endTime="1198.514">
<Sync time="1140.74"/>
I think it's like dominoes, man, [laugh] you know we saw that video. It's it's if when more and more start doing it, then yeah, there's more likely a chance and maybe that is maybe maybe he knows you know, he, 
<Sync time="1153.155"/>
Tua may have not announced his decisions, but who's to say he hasn't contacted a couple of his teammates and told them what what what's up what he's gonna be doing, #um, because some of these guys are getting it, you know, they're, 
<Sync time="1165.335"/>
they're thinking about jumping to the draft and you start seeing all those dollar signs man, it's kinda hard to to look back, so this is interesting. I I I think too it could blow up in your face, man. 
<Sync time="1178.774"/>
You know what I'm saying? I I I've seen I've seen players you know, saying you know what, I think I'm gonna come back and we're gonna, we're gonna win this thing and next thing you know, they're like, no you know, [laugh] 
<Sync time="1189.409"/>
I'm going to the draft you know. It's just we've seen that before and and, #um, I don't know with Bama, you're just on pins and needles specially till the six.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1198.514" endTime="1235.736">
<Sync time="1198.514"/>
Well, speaking of that Shane kinda the indecisiveness that we had also had an interesting nugget here on Thursday because Dylan Moses, after his big announcement that he will be returning for twenty twenty. 
<Sync time="1209.478"/>
He has put out a statement that says that is not necessarily the case. So he is going to push his decision back till January twentieth, that's the deadline for making the decision for the twenty twenty &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; Draft. 
<Sync time="1223.755"/>
And the reason being Shane, this is interesting, I've never ÄŒSSD ~ we've never quite seen this before but apparently, Dylan Moses took out an insurance policy on you know, potential injury.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1235.736" endTime="1236.169">
<Sync time="1235.736"/>
Yep.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1236.169" endTime="1243.656">
<Sync time="1236.169"/>
And he did this last spring before he got hurt and he was evaluated as a first-round pick.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1243.656" endTime="1244.232">
<Sync time="1243.656"/>
Yeah.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1244.232" endTime="1322.419">
<Sync time="1244.232"/>
So if you, you know, get injured and you're~ You can't be a first round pick, you get a lot more money and now apparently, according to a statement he released, he was recently evaluated once again by the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt;, 
<Sync time="1257.814"/>
of course after this injury that he suffered in training camp and they're saying he's a second round pick now. So there's already a loss of value based on his insurance policy and from my understanding, 
<Sync time="1271.833"/>
they're trying to make sure that if he returns, that the insurance is on first round value, and not on second round value and if it's if it's second round value, if they say, well, hey, you, you're taking this chance, you've already gotten hurt. 
<Sync time="1286.710"/>
If you get hurt again, we're giving you second round money. I think he's going to the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; now because he's got that insurance and basically, for anyone that I know, this is kind of complicated, but what this means is, 
<Sync time="1298.47"/>
if he gets if he goes to the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; Draft now and he is a second round pick, the insurance will pay the difference of what he would have got if he was a first rounder, if that makes sense. So he will get the money that he was essentially, 
<Sync time="1312.043"/>
you know, projected as in the spring, whereas now he's a notch below. So they're kind of protecting themselves, to make sure that he gets the money that #uh, he was once evaluated at.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1322.419" endTime="1331.604">

Oh, okay, so that's why Saban's doing all these Aflacs commercials huh? [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1331.604" endTime="1360.293">
<Sync time="1331.604"/>
And this statement is one of the weirdest damn things. This comes from his father who was apparently an attorney but he called him a ~~ÄŒSSD trust protector of the royal crown. That was pretty odd. 
<Sync time="1343.401"/>
He called him, #uh, Your Majesty or something like that. #uh The Lords of London is who he says, #uh, is ensuring him, 
<Sync time="1351.561"/>
#uh, but this is just a wacky wacky kind of statement here. Yes, statement from the trust protector of the royal crown. So. [laugh]
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1360.293" endTime="1384.794">
<Sync time="1360.293"/>
So, [laugh] let me ask you, Your Highness is ~~. is this the same thing Did Tua do the same thing? So I mean, even if he slipped into the second round ~, I mean, is this something that all players are doing? I don't I mean, I'm, I'm, 
<Sync time="1374.914"/>
I'm aware that there are these insurance policies out there, but are they just for the upper echelon guys typically first rounders, is that~.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1384.794" endTime="1453.626">
<Sync time="1384.794"/>
Yeah, that's interesting. I think, #uh~, I don't necessarily think it is. I think it's more and more guys are doing this, because I I recall a number of years ago, you know, this wasn't that long ago. I want to say twenty sixteen, twenty seventeen, 
<Sync time="1399.044"/>
Arkansas had a running back, Rollie Williams who injured his neck and then he came back and then he got that insurance policy and then he hurt his neck again and I think it was spring and they came out and 
<Sync time="1411.809"/>
the insurer wouldn't pay him because, #yes~ , he injured his neck, but it was not, you know, a career ending injury. They basically I think they just told him, hey, man, if you get hit in the neck again, like this, you could be paralyzed.
<Sync time="1425.759"/>
So he~so he walked away from the game. #~ Thank thank God, you know, he's not paralyzed or anything. Because he was not paralyzed this insurance place didn't want to pay him. So #uh and I don't think he was anything like a first round pick. 
<Sync time="1439.473"/>
I think he's certainly would have been a draft pick but yeah I think a lot of guys at these &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; schools take out these insurance policies and I would be stunned I don't know for a fact but I would be stunned if ,~. Tua did not have one of these coming into the season and then #uh, who knows, maybe #

<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1453.626" endTime="1482.174">

<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1514.021" endTime="1616.779">
<Sync time="1514.021"/>
Uh-huh. Well, speaking of tangled ,#eh webs, Shane, let's jump on down to the state of Mississippi where we got some interesting one. We got some coaching movement here for the rebels, Lane Kiffin filing out his staff pretty well here 
<Sync time="1527.614"/>
and we kind of hit on this on a.#uh previous podcast but Michigan special team's coordinator Chris Partridge, officially hired by Ole Miss. They've also stolen away Texas tight end coach, 
<Sync time="1539.518"/>
Joe Jon Finley and he was previously .#uh at Missouri as well and, #uh, you know, Missouri's had Albert O and some other tight ends this last season at Texas &lt;initial&gt; A &lt;/initial&gt; and &lt;initial&gt; M &lt;/initial&gt;, 
<Sync time="1551.034"/>
they had Whiter Meyer the freshmen do it really well, so #uh. I love that hire. #um We kind of~~we've kind of already discussed this Partridge and how kind of Kiffin's going with recruiting over &lt;initial&gt; X &lt;/initial&gt; s and &lt;initial&gt; O &lt;/initial&gt; s in my opinion. 
<Sync time="1563.615"/>
And then the kind of the biggest news here, #um, Shane, Ole Miss has hired &lt;initial&gt; D. J. &lt;/initial&gt; Durkin, the former Maryland head coach where the the player Jordan McNair died during the conditioning and Maryland fired Durkin and 
<Sync time="1577.293"/>
he's been in the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; since that time so it's kind of an interesting one where you got you know, national media calling out Lane Kiffin and Ole Miss and you got you know, the rebel fan base and and the media saying they're just have to get us, 
<Sync time="1591.572"/>
so [laugh] I know this this is just an interesting one. I I honestly find the hire of the Chris Partridge guy from Michigan a little bit more interesting just because he's from what I understand going to be the defensive coordinator so 
<Sync time="1604.156"/>
I really would have went with Mike McIntyre. But they're clearly leaning towards recruiting. &lt;initial&gt; D. J. &lt;/initial&gt; Durkin is a is known to be an outstanding recruiter, but you know, all these &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; schools are going to be using that Maryland situation against them.

<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1619.77" endTime="1660.705">
<Sync time="1619.77"/>
Yeah. I just I don't know, I I think it's still a little too fresh and I know Ole Miss likes to wants to stay in the in the lot, but that one right there when you're when you're weighing your pros and cons it's not like he's some guru, 
<Sync time="1634.136"/>
you know, it's not like he's gonna come in and just transform this this team into a different ballclub, but he's I mean, he's a good coach but I don't know that negative recruiting I could just hear it now. 
<Sync time="1647.192"/>
#uH Why do you want to stand your boy down the one of the hottest stadiums in the world you know where he's working him out? You know, I just I just think that there'd be more negativity coming from this than positivity. So.

<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1660.705" endTime="1712.296">
<Sync time="1660.705"/>
The &lt;initial&gt; AD &lt;/initial&gt; has already released a statement saying, you know, they vetted this guy, they've researched him and everything so I don't know if you really want like you sa~ I mean, like you said, he they're not even getting a hot shot coordinator here. 
<Sync time="1673.269"/>
I don't know if you really~â€” want a damn &lt;initial&gt; AD &lt;/initial&gt; having to release a statement because you made a assistant coaching hire. I would say you know, the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; they, they also do kind of like a background on all these assistant hires and, if they signed off on it, 
<Sync time="1687.644"/>
#um I think you got to give ~, the rebels credit for, you know, making a move that this guy probably is, you know, it's really, really hard I, it's almost insensitive to say look past what happened in Maryland, but 
<Sync time="1699.792"/>
if you are able to do that he ,~â€” has been a quality coach, he's been at he was at Florida. He was their defensive coordinator he was outstanding there, #Uh but yeah, I don't know if I'd make this hire. I certainly, I don't think I would but,

<Sync time="1734.346"/>
one thing that I do like about the situation especially with recruiting is these guys are coming like from totally different regions, you know, so maybe there some of these guys were exposed to different athletes up north or, 
<Sync time="1746.733"/>
or out east and, #Eh, Lane would be able to take advantage of it.

<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="1750.435" endTime="1835.047">

Uh-huh. Now, staying in state Shane, let's jump on down to Mississippi State, where, you know, there's speculation, not reporting anything, but there's some wild speculation, Shane, and Joe Morehead maybe out of Mississippi State after this, #uhh, 
<Sync time="1764.47"/>
you know, disastrous Music City Bowl performance against Louisville. And hell, I didn't even really want to bring this up that much because I just thought it was a bunch of, you know, smoke here, and there's no fire but anybody missed it. I'm going to plug myself here. 
<Sync time="1778.916"/>
I was on # uh Paul Finebaum's show here on Thursday and even he asked me about it and he said, Mississippi State's even got a candidate lined up here ready to replace him. Although he noted that he did not think that it was going to go down. 
<Sync time="1793.855"/>
He did not want to reveal that name. I think, uh, if I had to guess Shane, and this is from speaking to people down there. I think the, the guy he's talking about is probably Billy Napier, the, ah, Lafayette 
<Sync time="1806.871"/>
head coach, former Alabama, eh, I believe is receivers coach. I bel~ I believe he's offensive coordinator at Arizona State. He's had a hell of a year down there at, hm, Louisiana Lafayette, so I would imagine that's kind of the guy they're talking about. But,
<Sync time="1820.983"/>
I don't know. What are your thoughts on this, Shane, where, hell, if you're gonna get rid of Joe Moorhead or you were gonna keep him and no~ now, he just lost a game. You, are you firing a guy because he lost a bowl game or maybe because of this fight or, I, I don't know. Th~ this is kinda out of left field for me.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="1835.047" endTime="1910.685">

I don't know, man, but Jus~ Justin had a little bit of an attitude lately, too, you know, coming out in these, #uh, in these, #uh, conferences. I've, I've, I've, listen, I mean, you could just tell in his voice that he's, you know, he's getting a lot of pressure on him. 
<Sync time="1848.588"/>
And, #um, the, I, I, I think they did well in the recruiting. I thought the Egg Bowl, I mean, it's, it's all been, it's like slowly going downhill. #um You know, it's like the Egg Bowl was the, was the top of the mountain. 
<Sync time="1861.408"/>
And then the recruiting class was good but it wasn't like, you know. You just had frickin' Lane Kiffin, you know, two hours away to show up, you know. So that's what people are talking about Mississippi. And then you go to your, #uh, you get your quarterback, 
<Sync time="1875.986"/>
gets a black eye, and then you lose your ball game. And it's just, it~ it's just slowly going downhill, and, and here, you're going into your offseason. So there's just no, there's no excitement. Nobody is talking about how great Mississippi State is gonna be next year. 
<Sync time="1888.994"/>
And, you know, that's something that they actually have had some buzz the last few seasons. So, #uh, it would not surprise me, #uh, if it were to happen but I think it would be a dumb move. 
<Sync time="1900.7"/>
I, I think, you know, we still got to give Joe some time. He did have a decent recruiting class. He was able to keep a lot of kids inside Mississippi's, #uh, in Mississippi State.

They'd, we, we got that last drive and then the onside kick, I wasn't even expecting that happen that. And those usually never worked. That was just, I don't know, man. He was smiling on us today, buddy. He was.

<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="2088.284" endTime="2142.455">
<Sync time="2088.284"/>
Yeah and I mean, I swear that was the twentieth onside kick they've, they've attempted under Jeremy Pruitt. And I'd say about all of them are ba~ were basically executed to perfection. The kicks I'm talking about, but they just never seem to recover. I mean, this one. 
<Sync time="2102.124"/>
It all clicked for Tennessee. They, of course, they did that when they were trailing by six and then even, I, I mean that's just the Tennessee way. Nothing's easy. They take the lead, #uh, Indiana gets the ball back with a field goal attempt to win the game 
<Sync time="2116.956"/>
and it, I swear that was, that kick was going in. I mean it looks good. It looked long, and then it just squeaked by the up right there. Tennessee gets the ball back. What was it about ninety-something seconds left Indiana only having one timeout 
<Sync time="2130.922"/>
and somehow Indiana got the ball back [laugh] (()) and another chance to drive it. I mean, damn, Tennessee is just, I, I don't know how you haven't had, #uh, at least, one heart attack just watching this damn thing yet.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="2142.455" endTime="2242.87">
<Sync time="2142.455"/>
[laugh] I'm telling you, your New Year's resolution was to drink less alcohol but you are not a volunteer. [laugh] I was, #uh, the ups and downs, my heart rate's up and down. I'm telling you this was a, 
<Sync time="2157.095"/>
[breath] this was a wild game, #um, you know. We've, we know a few people went down there. My brother, I heard your cousin, he went down there and he says it was electric. It was a Tennessee environment. And 
<Sync time="2168.757"/>
[breath] I don't know, man. It was just, this is just fitting. This is Tennessee football right here, man, just, you know, they piss you off even though they win, you know. [laugh] It's like they just know what to do and, 
<Sync time="2181.069"/>
[breath] oh, man, this was fantastic. I, I thought this kicker, you know, this is the thing that drove me nuts. This kicker, they tell us how bad he is but he looks like damn, you know, #uh, the, the, oh, one of the, [laugh] you know what I'm saying. 
<Sync time="2195.176"/>
He looks like Vanderjagt out there or, you know, one of these Hall-of-Fame kickers from the &lt;initial&gt; NFL &lt;/initial&gt; just nailing it. And when he had that opportunity to, to kick at one and it just went it off to the right, I was just, I thought it was in there for a second, man. 
<Sync time="2209.421"/>
And then we, we played that previous defense at the end, and I was like, man, we're just, we just giving it to him, man. There were thirteen, twenty yards down the field all sudden. 
<Sync time="2218.687"/>
They're like, you know, hey, that's not gonna work, you know. And then, and then at the back of my mind, I'm thinking &lt;initial&gt; BYU &lt;/initial&gt;. We get burnt deep. You know what I'm saying. But, I mean, credit this defense. 
<Sync time="2229.325"/>
There, there was times in this game that frustrated you on the defense but all, I mean, because the quarterback, you know, scrambling. I think that was the biggest one. But other than that, this defense was fantastic.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="2242.87" endTime="2351.808">
<Sync time="2242.87"/>
Yeah, and this, #uh, this had to be, you know, a frustrating game. That that's a perfect word you used there because at the beginning, first quarter, Tennessee dominated, unable to execute in the red zone. They went for it in the first possession there, got stopped on the goal line. 
<Sync time="2257.317"/>
Second possession or the second time in the red zone, I should say, once again, very close to the goal line inside the ten, five yard line unable to punch it in and then had to settle for a field goal, but 
<Sync time="2270.128"/>
it just felt like Tennessee, had they punched those ones in early, and there were plays to be made. Guarantano was, you know, kind of the typical, what we've seen from him this year, just kind of hesitant, a little bit behind 
<Sync time="2282.364"/>
or wait until defenders kinda get in position to make his throw. And if he was a little bit more on point, I mean, Tennessee would have started this game fourteen to zero. And the way, the way the defense was playing, this thing could have got real ugly real quick 
<Sync time="2296.71"/>
but since they didn't punch those in, you just knew that Indiana was gonna come storming back. That's what happened. All of a sudden, hell, this quarterback named after Peyton Manning, he did his, not a Peyton Manning impersonation as he look, he's looking like Michael Vick out there. What do you~
<Sync time="2310.575"/>
he was right in everything with his damn legs. It looked like Tennessee was gonna get haunted yet again by a dual threat type quarterback, but then all of a sudden, #um, I mean, I, Tennessee was pressuring him but he was still escaping until that fourth quarter 
<Sync time="2324.848"/>
and it all turned around. And I saw a lot of people criticizing Jeremy Pruitt. You know, he can't coach when he's got time to prep and all of this, but hell, I mean, it's how you finish the game. In Tennessee, I know there were some mistakes like we noted there, but 
<Sync time="2339.14"/>
you got to feel good about the direction of the team. Jeremy Pruitt won an (()) in bowl games now and I mean, eight and five, that's a hell of a lot better than seven and six for some reason going to the offseason, don't you feel like.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="2351.808" endTime="2388.732">
<Sync time="2351.808"/>
Absolutely, man. I thought he prepared fantas~ I mean, obviously, the offense was frustrating but you gotta remember, #uh, this is Chaney's thing. This is Chaney's baby. When it comes to offense, it's not Pruitt. 
<Sync time="2364.277"/>
Pruitt is about that defense which is night and day from the start of this season. And I thought he was prepared, you know, going into this game. It was just, #uh, you, I mean, how do you prepare for a quarterback that really hasn't scrambled all season long. 
<Sync time="2378.775"/>
Do you know what I'm saying. It's just they finally found something that worked. We took their best player out. I mean, physically, he was out. And that, that, that whatever his name is, Shark kid.

<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="2389.351" endTime="2417.052">
<Sync time="2389.351"/>
He, he took some shots, man. He was, you know, bagged up on the sideline but we, we shut down the offense other than, you know, Peyton doing what he did with his legs. So I thought that was fantastic coaching, that was a ballsy move with the special teams, 
<Sync time="2403.672"/>
#um, you know, it was just the offense, you know, #uh, sputtered at times but that was that's Guarantano man that's, that's not this coordinator that's not the play calling, it's just that's our quarterback man.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="2417.052" endTime="2469.701">
<Sync time="2417.052"/>
Now, one of the guys I had mentioned leading up to this game, Eric Gray, he led the team in rushing, he looked really good, eight six yards on fourteen carries, added another thirty four receiving, 
<Sync time="2428.057"/>
I think you got a I don't wanna say build the offense around him next season but he's probably the breakout performer with all these receivers going and I don't know about you, Shane but I really think that, #uh, we knew Jauan Jennings was gonna miss the first half, but 
<Sync time="2442.520"/>
I think that really hurt the offense in the first half and then I think it even hurt them in the second half because it just seemed like they were trying to force-feed him early in the third quarter once you know he got into the rhythm, the offense was a different story, 
<Sync time="2457.391"/>
he nearly took the game over there on his own back there on the on the wild dog package there, but it was just kind of out of sync all all day till the fourth quarter there with Jauan Jennings having to miss the first half.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="2469.701" endTime="2513.759">
<Sync time="2469.701"/>
But I think that was an adjustment, man, I I think obviously hardest in the first half in the second half is shouldn't have, #uh, you know, because Indiana knew he was coming 
<Sync time="2479.965"/>
and when~ and when number fifteen was on the field they had two guys on him at all times, which freed up Gray underneath which I think the biggest surprise for me was was some of these routes that Gray was running I mean they weren't like, 
<Sync time="2493.728"/>
I mean we're not talking like fifteen yard outs or anything like that but he was getting open, he was catching the ball down the field and he was always wide open because they were so focused on number fifteen. So, 
<Sync time="2504.662"/>
I think once the adjustment came down I think they took advantage of, #uh, Indiana's game plan for, #uh, to get Jauan Jennings out of the game.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="2513.759" endTime="2532.562">
<Sync time="2513.759"/>
Now, I gotta ask you this, Shane, Tennessee started oh and two on the season, finished eight and five with a, not a New Year's Day but a [laugh] New Year's second bowl game win, 
<Sync time="2524.475"/>
the direction of Tennessee, how happy are you heading into twenty twenty as our, #uh, resident Tennessee Homer here?
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk13" startTime="2532.562" endTime="2616.347">
<Sync time="2532.562"/>
I'm happy, #uh, #uh, but there's there's there's one little thing here, man. All right, I'm not happy with the quarterback situation and you know, I~ I know, 
<Sync time="2546.71"/>
I just know number two is gonna be back next year and there were some times that he won us a game, but like I said, I think there was some times he hindered us and I don't, you know, 
<Sync time="2559.922"/>
I don't think Guarantano is a quarterback that can take you to ten wins. I think he's a guy who can get you to a bowl game, but I don't think he can get you to ten wins and I don't know if, #uh, you know Harris, #uh, we don't know. True freshmen they're they're a hit or miss. 
<Sync time="2574.543"/>
We don't know if that's gonna be the answer but is one of these backups you know is is is Brian gonna be a little bit healthier next year, is he gonna be a contender. I just I think we need help at that quarterback spot. 
<Sync time="2588.203"/>
We're obviously gonna need some assistance in the wide receiving spot because, you know, we're we're they weren't a huge factor in this game, but you know, we're gonna have to have some I mean, you you've seen teams without wide receivers, man, 
<Sync time="2601.879"/>
and if they get too one-dimensional, they get too predictable, and I I so I'm a little concerned with the offense, but I do love the offensive line. I love the running backs. I love this defense. So, yes, I am excited about the next year.
</Turn>
<Turn speaker="spk12" startTime="2616.347" endTime="2668.386">
<Sync time="2616.347"/>
Uh-huh. And I think you make a good point because we see the college football playoff dominated by elite quarterbacks. Quarterbacks have always been the most important position in modern football, but I think in today's day and age, 
<Sync time="2629.322"/>
they're even more important and you simply cannot win, you know at the highest level without that elite quarterback, so that's gonna be the challenge moving forward for Tennessee in the twenty twenty season, 
<Sync time="2641.135"/>
maybe it's #uh Harrison Bailey, maybe it's Brian Mauer, you know, hell, I mean for as low as Guarantano looked at dabs, maybe he takes that next step, but if we've seen a guy for several years, you kinda, they kinda are what they are, you know what I mean. So, 
<Sync time="2655.066"/>
that's gonna be the big challenge I think for Pruitt and company moving forward, but just a hell of a win here for Tennessee and the &lt;initial&gt; SEC &lt;/initial&gt; now I believe they're what are they eight and two I think in bowl games something like that and only~
